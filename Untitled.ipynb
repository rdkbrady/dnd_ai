Aasimars are not always good, but it is a natural tendency for them, and they gravitate to good faiths or organizations associated with celestials. Aasimar heritage can hide for generations, only to appear suddenly in the child of two apparently human parents. Most societies interpret aasimar births as good omens. Aasimars look mostly human except for some minor physical trait that reveals their unusual heritage. Typical aasimar features are hair that shines like metal, unusual eye or skin color, or even glowing golden halos. Aasimar Characters Aasimars are defined by class levels-they do not possess racial Hit Dice. Aasimars have the following racial traits. +2 Charisma, +2 Wisdom: Aasimars are insightful, confident, and personable. Normal Speed: Aasimars have a base speed of 30 feet. Darkvision: Aasimars can see in the dark up to 60 feet. Skilled: Aasimars have a +2 racial bonus on Diplomacy and Perception checks. Spell-Like Ability: Aasimars can use daylight once per day as a spell-like ability (caster level equals the aasimar's class level). Celestial Resistance: Aasimars have acid resistance 5, cold resistance 5, and electricity resistance 5. Languages: Aasimars begin play speaking Common and Celestial. Aasimars with high Intelligence scores can choose any of the following bonus languages: Draconic, Dwarven, Elven, Gnome, Half ling, and Sylvan.\"},\n",

They once ruled the world with vast empires, and today view most other forms of life as either food or slaves-and sometimes both. They disdain the gods and see themselves as the true masters of creation. An aboleth is 25 feet long and weighs 6,500 pounds. In the darkest reaches of the sea, aboleths still dwell in grotesque cities built in nauseating and cyclopean styles. There they are served by countless slaves culled from every nation, air-breathing and aquatic alike, although the air-breathing slaves are doubly bound by magic and the need to constantly replenish their water-breathing ability via the excretions of their aboleth masters. Lone aboleths are often advance scouts for these hidden cities, seeking out new slaves.\"},\n",

Astral devas are usually created by deities from the souls of good mortals, though some souls spontaneously transform into astral devas without the intervention of a deity. Their skills and abilities make them excellent scouts and elite agents for celestial armies. They often carry long, flowing scrolls upon which are writ messages and judgments from the gods. An astral deva's scrolls frequently contain hints of prophecies and major events yet to come, and as such the devas are fiercely protective of the contents of these scrolls and let none, not even other astral devas, peruse them.\"},\n",

       "   'description': 'Solars are the greatest type of angel, usually serving at the right hand of a deity or championing a cause that benefits an entire world or plane. A typical solar looks roughly human, though some physically resemble other humanoid races and a rare few have even more unusual forms. A solar stands about 9 feet tall and weighs about 500 pounds, with a strong, commanding voice that is impossible to ignore. Most have silvery or golden skin. Blessed with an array of magical powers and the spellcasting abilities of the most powerful clerics, solars are powerful opponents capable of single-handedly slaying mighty evils. They are the greatest trackers among the celestials, the most masterful of which are said to be able to track the days-old wake of a pit fiend flying through the Astral Plane. Some take on the mantle of monster-slayers and hunt powerful fiends and undead such as devourers, night hags, night shades, and pit fiends, even making forays into the evil planes and the Negative Energy Plane to destroy these creatures at their source before they can bring harm to mortals. A few very old solars have succeeded at this task and bear slayer-names of dread creatures that are now extinct by the solar\\'s hand. Solars accept roles as guardians, usually of fundamental supernatural concepts, or objects or creatures of great importance. On one world, a group of solars patrols the energy conduits of the sun, alert for any attempts by evil races such as drow to snuff out the light and bring eternal darkness. On another, seven solars stand watch over seven mystical chains keeping evil gods bound within a prison demiplane. On yet another, a solar with a flaming sword stands watch over the original mortal paradise so that no creature may enter. In worlds where the gods cannot take physical form, they send solars to be their prophets and gurus (often pretending to be mortals), laying the foundation for cults that grow to become great religions. Likewise, in worlds oppressed by evil, solars are the secret priests who bring hope to the downtrodden, or in some cases allow themselves to be martyred so that their holy essence can explode outward to land and grow in the hearts of great heroes-to-be. Though they are not gods, the solars\\' power approaches that of demigods, and they often have an advisory role for younger or weaker deities. In some polytheistic faiths, mortals worship one or more solars as aspects or near-equal servants of the true deities-never without the deity\\'s approval-or consider notable solars to be offspring, consorts, lovers, or spouses of true deities (which they may be, depending on the deity). Unlike other angels, most solars are created from an amalgam of good souls and raw divine energy to directly serve the gods, but an increasing number of these powerful angels have been \"promoted\" to their existence as solars from lesser creatures like planetars or devas. A few rare and powerful good souls ascend directly to the status of solar. The oldest solars predate mortality and are among the gods\\' first creations. These strange solars are paragons of their kind and have little direct interaction with mortals, focusing on the protection or destruction of abstract concepts such as gravity, dark matter, entropy, and primordial evil. Solars who spend a long time in the Material Plane, especially those in the guise of mortals, are sometimes the source of halfcelestial or aasimar bloodlines in mortal families, due either to romantic dalliances or simply the mortals\\' proximity to celestial energy. Actual offspring are rare, and when they occur, it is always a mortal mother that bears the child-while solars can appear as either sex, the gods have not granted them the capacity for pregnancy or motherhood. Indeed, this fundamental truth is often what drives a solar to seek out a mortal lover. Since begetting a child upon a mortal is generally frowned upon by other solars, a solar father rarely interacts directly with the fate of his lover or child, so as to avoid bringing shame upon himself or his responsibilities. Yet such solars still watch over their progeny from afar, and in times of peril, they might even be moved to intercede to aid one of their endangered children, albiet in subtle and mysterious ways. All angels respect the power and wisdom of solars, and though these mightiest of angels usually work alone, they sometimes command multiple armies led by planetars, acting as great field marshals for massive incursions against the legions of Hell or the hordes of the Abyss.'},\n",

       "   'description': 'Ankhegs are an all-too-common plague upon the rural areas of the world. These horse-sized burrowing monsters generally avoid heavily settled areas like cities, but their predilection for livestock and humanoid f lesh ensures that they do not keep to the deep wilderness either. Their preferred habitat is rural farmlands, as the loose soil of such regions makes it easy for the creatures to burrow. Tales speak of larger ankhegs that dwell in remote deserts-such creatures likely feed primarily on giant scorpions and camels, and rarely come in contact with civilization due to their remote locations. (A desert ankheg is a Huge advanced ankheg.) In combat, an ankheg prefers to attack with its bite. Against multiple foes, an ankheg often grabs one of the available targets and then attempts to retreat to safety, burrowing into the ground. A creature carried underground can still breathe with diff iculty (the ankheg needs to breathe as well, so its tunnels are relatively porous), but is often eaten alive before its allies can rescue it. Ankhegs burrow with their legs and mandibles, moving with unsettling speed through loose soil, sand, gravel, and the like-they cannot burrow through solid stone. Burrowing ankhegs can construct tunnels by pausing frequently to shore up the walls with a thicker, less caustic secretion from their mouths. If an ankheg chooses to make a permanent tunnel when burrowing, it moves at half speed. A typical ankheg tunnel is 10 feet tall and wide, roughly circular in cross-section, and from 60 to 150 feet long ([1d10 +5] x 10). Clusters of ankhegs often share the same territory and create intricate winding networks of tunnels under farmlands, sometimes resulting in sinkholes where too many burrow at once. Although ankhegs resemble immense vermin, they are in fact much more intelligent than the typical arachnid and, given time and a talented trainer, can even be trained to serve as mounts or beasts of burden. The fact that even \"domesticated\" ankhegs are prone to squirting acid when frightened or startled makes them unsafe at best in most heavily populated regions, but for more savage races like hobgoblins, troglodytes, and particularly orcs, ankhegs make popular guardians or even pets.'},\n",

Well trained, they prefer to make use of their greatswords in battle, though they are equally adept with their natural weapons. Hound archons loathe killing mortals and prefer to disarm or incapacitate even evil individuals when they can. Against fiends and the irredeemably corrupt, though, they show no mercy. Hound archons are disciplined soldiers and sentinels. Occasionally good-aligned deities send them to watch over specific places and individuals they take a particular interest in. Under the guise of unassuming but friendly strays, such secret defenders might follow their ward or guard their post subtly for years. In Heaven's armies, exceptional hound archon paladins lead their fellows into combat, taking on roles as captains and knights. They lead incursions against fiendish holdings, whether that entails strikes against daemonic fortresses or liberating the captives of night hag soul collectors. Such missions make hound archons perhaps the most likely celestials one might encounter upon the Lower Planes, and packs of swift-moving wolves occasionally reveal themselves to be welcome saviors to those lost within such realms. Regardless of their orders, hound archons universally exhibit a particular hatred of canine fiends, abandoning all mercy and going out of their way to put an end to the evils of barghests, glabrezus, yeth hounds, and similar depraved outsiders.\"},\n",

Their bodies, however, are merely globes of spiritual purity and pale light, and though they might interact with their surroundings through pure force of will, such interaction proves too weak to help with most physical tasks. Their evasive natures make them exceptional at scouting-at least in areas where strange lights aren't unusual-relaying messages, and overwhelming enemies with surprise and group tactics. Although they appear fragile, their forms guard them against all but the most profane attacks. A lantern archon always glows, usually as bright as a torch. They have total control over the color of light they shed, and take great pleasure in modulating their colors and brightness in time to music or to entertain other creatures. Most lantern archons speak in airy, echoing voices, with tones that range from somber whispers to hurried chirping. Often, their light fluctuates along with their words or tones, punctuating their speech with sparks of light or gentle pulses. As a swift action, a lantern archon can dampen its light to that of a candle for 1 round. Only death can extinguish this light. As lantern archons never sleep or eat, they make excellent watchers and guardians. Lantern archons light many settlements in the celestial realms in lieu of mundane or magical illumination, serving as disguised sentinels always watchful for approaching evil. Small but fast and zealous, lantern archons make excellent support troops in celestial armies, swarming over weak opponents or teleporting en masse to flanking positions to cut off reinforcements or escape routes. These miniature archons work well together and know that there is great strength in numbers, uniting in times of need and desperation to form gestalts with greater control over their surroundings. Especially brave lantern archons might eventually be promoted into a more powerful kind of archon, but most are content with their status.\"},\n",

Possessing no intelligence or agenda, they lash out at whatever living things pass nearby, regardless of the target's size, sentience, or potential deadliness. A mature plant consists of a main vine, about 20 feet long; smaller vines up to 5 feet long branch off from the main vine about every 6 inches. These small vines bear clusters of leaves, and in late summer they produce bunches of small fruits that resemble wild blackberries. The fruit is tough and has a hearty and typically bitter flavor, although some say the berries change in taste depending on what victims composted a given plant's roots. The most murderous assassin vines supposedly produce the sweetest berries. An assassin vine can move about, but usually stays put unless it needs to seek prey in a new vicinity. The plants use simple tactics, lying still until prey comes within reach and then attacking. Once an assassin vine is engaged, it pursues prey (albeit slowly) in order to catch and compost the creature. The plants prove tenacious, as long as their quarry remains within sight. Once a creature moves beyond the plant's ability to perceive it, the unthinking vine falls still and lies in wait for the next passerby. Assassin vines lurk within dense forests and swamps, but some might encroach upon poorly tended fields and vineyards. The vine's seeds might be spread far by birds swift enough to pluck them and escape. Tales often tell of assassin vines appearing in flower beds or infiltrating greenhouses, murderous surprises planted by rivals and enemies or arbitrary doom dropped by unsuspecting wing.\"},\n",

       "   'description': 'The basilisk, often called the \"King of Serpents,\" is in fact not a serpent at all, but rather an eight-legged reptile with a nasty disposition and the ability to turn creatures to stone with its gaze. Folklore holds that, much like the cockatrice, the first basilisks hatched from eggs laid by snakes and incubated by roosters, but little in the basilisk\\'s physiology lends any credence to this claim. Basilisks live in nearly any terrestrial environment, from forest to desert, and their hides tend to match and ref lect their surroundings-a desert-dwelling basilisk might be tan or brown, while one that lives in a forest could be bright green. They tend to make their lairs in caves, burrows, or other sheltered areas, and these dens are often marked by statues of people and animals in lifelike poses-the petrified remains of those unfortunate enough to stumble across the basilisk. Basilisks have the ability to consume the creatures they petrify, their churning stomach acid dissolving and extracting nutrients from the stone, but the process is slow and inefficient, making them lazy and sluggish. As a result, basilisks rarely stalk prey or chase those who avoid their gaze, counting on their stealth and the element of surprise to keep them safe and fed. When not lying in wait for the small mammals, birds, and reptiles that normally make up their diet, basilisks spend their time sleeping in their lairs, and those brave enough to capture basilisks or hide treasure near them find that they make natural guardians and watchdogs. An adult basilisk is 13 feet long, with fully half of that made up by its long tail, and weighs 300 pounds. Some breeds have short, curved horns on their noses or small crests of bony growths topping their heads like crowns. Though normally solitary creatures, coming together only to mate and lay eggs, in particularly dangerous areas small groups may band together for protection and attack intruders en masse. For unknown reasons, weasels and ferrets are immune to the basilisk\\'s stare, and sometimes sneak into basilisk lairs while a parent is hunting in order to consume its young. Some legends suggest that a basilisk\\'s blood can transmute common stones into other material, but this is likely a case of witnesses misinterpreting the magical restoration of previously petrified creatures or body parts.'},\n",

The creature's six pairs of powerful, clawed legs remain folded against its sides most of the time, only extending in combat to grapple foes or carry the behir forward in a terrifying, low-slung gallop, or else when climbing the sheer cliff faces common to behir lairs. The average behir is 40 feet long and weighs 4,000 pounds. In addition to the two prominent horns on its head, many have additional decorative spines at regular intervals along the central ridges of their backs. While territorial and bestial in its fury, the behir is neither stupid nor necessarily evil, though its selfcenteredness and tendency to lay claim to everything visible from its high lairs frequently bring it into conf lict with other races. As such, a behir can often be bought off or reasoned with by those brave negotiators willing to get close enough to make their pitch. In these cases, a behir's tendency to attack first and ask questions later (or not at all) means that anyone seeking to strike a deal must bring powerful incentives and impress the behir immediately with his offer. It's often been speculated that behirs are somehow related to blue dragons, but the exact nature of this link remains unknown. Most dragons deny any such association and look down on the behir for its relative lack of intelligence-a snubbing that infuriates the already short-tempered behir. Thanks to this casual disparagement, many behirs carry deep grudges against dragons, and attack without pause any who cross into their territories.\"},\n",

These creatures make their homes near large rivers or deep in marshes. There they make small villages composed of mud mounds on the banks. Boggards start out life as tadpoles in breeding ponds, eventually growing to a length of 3 feet before sprouting arms and legs and becoming capable of terrestrial living. Acceptance into the clan then depends on the young boggard's successful hunt to kill a sentient humanoid. Those who fail are exiled from the clan. As boggards age, they continue to grow and lose their coloration. Exceptionally old boggards bear completely white skin covering massive corpulent bodies. Some of these boggards rank among the caste of priest-kings and enjoy a life of grotesque pleasures ruling their clans. Though often hunched over, boggards stand 5 feet tall and weigh close to 200 pounds. These creatures live for 50 years, though the harsh swamps and infighting usually cut these years short.\"},\n",

       "   'description': \"The bugbear is the largest of the goblinoid races, a lumbering brute that stands at least a head taller than most humans. They are loners, preferring to live and kill on their own rather than form tribes of their own kind, yet it isn't uncommon to find small bands of bugbears working together, or dwelling in goblin or hobgoblin tribes where they function as elite guards or executioners. Bugbears do not form large warrens like goblins or nations like hobgoblins; they prefer smaller-scale mayhem that lets them keep their favorite acts (murder and torture) on a more personal level. Humans are a bugbear's favored prey, and most count the flesh of humanity as a dietary staple. Grisly trophies of ears or fingers are common bugbear decorations. Bugbears, when they turn to religion, favor gods of murder and violence, with various demon lords being favorites. A typical bugbear stands 7 feet in height and weighs 400 pounds. The Nature of Goblinoid Evil Goblins, hobgoblins, and bugbears, despite having superficial similarities, each represent a different face of evil. Hobgoblins are ordered and methodical in their evil, forming vast armies, warbands, and despotic nations. Goblins are the primal evil, seeking only cruelty and petty victimization as they can find it, be that among their own kind or against their neighbors. Yet the evil personified by the bugbear may be the most terrifying, for they actively seek to inf lict pain and suffering in the most destructive ways possible. When a hobgoblin kills, it's because of tradition and order. When a goblin kills, it's for fun. But when a bugbear holds its blade, it kills only when it can be assured that the murder will cause maximum pain and suffering to those its weapon does not touch; to a bugbear, the true goal of murder is to strike not at the victim, but at those who held the victim dear.\"},\n",

Burrowing rapidly through the earth just beneath the surface, sometimes with its armored fin cutting a distinctive wake behind it, the bulette launches itself free of stone and soil to tear into its prey without remorse, giving rise to the common appellation \"landshark.\" Bulettes are notoriously foul-tempered, attacking far larger creatures with no regard for personal safety. Solitary beasts except for the occasional mated pair, they spend most of their time patrolling the perimeters of territories that can stretch up to 30 square miles, hunting game and punishing interlopers with a fury that shakes the hillsides. Bulettes are perfect eating machines, consuming bones, armor, and even magical items with their powerful jaws and churning stomach acid. Lacking other food, the bulette might gnaw on inanimate objects, yet for unknown reasons no bulette voluntarily consumes elf flesh-a peccadillo many point to as evidence that elven wizardry was involved in its creation. Dwarves are also rarely eaten by the beasts, though the bulette still slaughters members of either race on sight. Half lings, on the other hand, are among the beast\\'s favorite meals, and no half ling with any sense ventures into bulette country casually. The bulette is a cunning fighter, surprising foes with its impressive agility. One of its favorite tactics is to charge forward and launch itself into the air in order to drop on its prey with all four razor-sharp claws extended. Folklore claims that the flesh behind the beast\\'s dorsal crest is particularly tender, and that those willing and able to wait until the fin is raised in the excitement of combat or mating can target it for a killing blow-yet most who have faced the landshark agree that the best way to win a fight with a bulette is to avoid it entirely.'},\n",

The creature's mode of hunting is unique-it clambers up a cave wall to settle on a ledge or in a crack, typically at a height of at least 30 feet. Ledges overlooking bridges and lower ledges overlooking chasms are favored hunting grounds for the cave fisher. The creature lies in wait until prey approaches within 60 feet, at which point it extrudes a thin cord of silk at blinding speed, lashing at the target as with a whip. The filament is incredibly sticky, and once the fisher strikes food with it, it reels in its meal to feed, trusting its position on a higher ledge to prevent any allies the meal may have from molesting it as it eats. Collections of bones and lengths of discarded filaments are sure signs of cave fisher habitation. A cave fisher produces its filament from glands in its body; when it reels in a victim, it generally eats the filament along with its meal. It's impossible to harvest new filaments from a dead cave fisher, but filaments harvested from living ones are incredibly light and strong, functioning as silk rope once the sticky adhesive on a length decomposes (which generally takes 3d6 minutes). A cave fisher's filament glands are useful in constructing sovereign glue and similar sticky magical items. A single cave fisher's glands count as 100 gp worth of raw materials, offsetting the total cost of the item's final creation. Although cave fishers have many superficial similarities to crabs, they do not fare well in water and aren't very good swimmers. Nevertheless, many cave fishers lair upon ledges overlooking swift-f lowing subterranean rivers, giving them a relatively steady stream of food, especially in cases where such rivers are used as trade routes. Those who ply these rivers frequently travel with a few spare slaves or some unwanted livestock, and when they approach a known cave fisher haunt, they send down the unfortunate animal or slave on a raft to distract the monster's hunger. A cave fisher is 7 feet long and weighs 400 pounds.\"},\n",

Typically found on the fringes of civilization, these stoic people vary widely in appearance, their skin tones typically appearing deeply tanned but similar to the humans who occupy nearby regions, while their lower bodies borrow the colorations of local equines. Centaur hair and eyes trend toward darker colors and their features tend to be broad, while the overall bulk of their bodies is inf luenced by the size of the horses their lower quarters resemble. Thus, while an average centaur stands over 7 feet tall and weights upward of 2,000 pounds, there are vast regional variations-from lean plains-runners to burly mountain hunters. Centaurs typically live to be about 60 years old. Aloof with other races and at odds even with their own kind, the centaurs are an old race only slowly coming to accept the modern world. While the majority of centaurs still live in tribes roaming vast plains or the fringes of eldritch forests, many have abandoned the isolationist ways of their ancestors to walk among the more cosmopolitan cities of the world. Often such free-spirited centaurs are considered outcasts and are shunned by their own tribes, making the decision to leave a heavy one. In some rare cases, however, whole tribes under progressive leaders have come to trade or make alliances with other humanoid communities-typically elves, but sometimes gnomes, and rarely humans or dwarves. Many races remain wary of centaurs, though, largely due to legends of territorial beastmen and the regular, violent encounters the centaurs have with stubborn settlers and expansionist countries.'},\n",

A chimera's dragon head may be of any evil dragon type, with the corresponding breath weapon, and its wings usually match the scales on its head. Chimeras speak with three overlapping voices, but rarely do so, typically only when playing toady to a more powerful creature. A chimera is 5 feet tall at the shoulder, nearly 10 feet long, and weighs 700 pounds. Chimeras prefer meat but can subsist on vegetable matter if necessary (although being forced to do so generally leaves the beasts more ill-tempered than usual). Their flight means they can pick and choose their prey, and they usually hunt a large area in search of easy food. They are too stupid and belligerent to acquire followers, though sometimes a tribe of kobolds might give them offerings. Conversely, they are just intelligent and stubborn enough that they make poor pets, and only a significantly more powerful creature can keep them submissive. They may form equal partnerships with a respectful humanoid or similar creature, and even consent to be used as a mount. A pride of chimeras is very leonine in its hierarchy, with a dominant male leading the group and most of the hunting done by the females. A solitary chimera may be a young male or a female with cubs nearby.\"},\n",

They seldom attack multiple enemies at once, stalking their quarry until they can isolate a weaker victim from its pack. Chokers walk with a disturbing, almost comical gait due to their extremely limber legs. Weighing only 35 pounds and standing no taller than a half ling, chokers have no problem skittering across walls and ceilings, often lodging themselves into shadowy corners, tunnel intersections, walls, or staircases. A choker will attempt to grasp creatures of almost any size, but prefers lone prey of its size or smaller. Chokers appear to have little culture of their own, gathering only brief ly to mate before their wanderlust and hunger spurs them again to a solitary existence. Their just-better-than-animalistic intelligence grants them a fascination with the trappings of society even if they do not truly understand it. Accordingly, the grubby lair of a choker (often situated in a diff icult-toreach nook or cranny) usually contains valuable objects such as rings, brooches, cloak clasps, and loose coins gathered from devoured victims. This fascination occasionally compels a choker to abandon its subterranean home for a closer study of the sunlit world's many civilizations. These chokers feel most at home in the darkened narrow alleyways of human cities, squeezing themselves into sewers, forgotten alcoves, barrels, and similar cramped, overlooked spaces. Chokers prefer to keep hidden during the light of day, emerging from their hidey-holes under cover of darkness to hunt for food and cruel pleasure. Favorite tactics include using their long arms to scoop prey off the street from the safety of a nearby rooftop, attacking sleeping families by squeezing through an open chimney, or tapping on a window to bring their curious food within grasping distance.\"},\n",

Chuuls are excellent swimmers but prefer to attack land-bound creatures or those wallowing in shallow water. Once they seize their victims, chuuls often drag grappled foes back into deep water to drown them. Lizardfolk are by far the chuul's favorite prey, though those pale chuul breeds that live underground prefer morlocks, duergar, unwary drow, and other unfortunates who get too close to their subterranean waterways-with the exception of troglodytes, whose flavor chuuls find particularly offensive. Chuuls are surprisingly intelligent, leading many to speculate fruitlessly on their origins and motivations. They speak a chittering, burbling dialect of Common, but few are inclined to speak to those outside their race, and if chuul society exists beyond their frenzied mating season, humanoids have yet to record it. Instead, chuul intellects seem entirely devoted to seeking out the perfect ambush sites to attack other intelligent creatures and decorating their elaborate lairs with trophies from their kills. Though the chuuls themselves seem uninterested in using tools of any kind, they have an almost compulsive need to collect keepsakes from their victims.

       "   'description': \"Stupid, vicious, and repulsive, cockatrices are avoided by other creatures due to their magical ability to turn flesh to stone. Legends say that the first cockatrice emerged from an egg laid by a cockerel and incubated by a toad. Whether or not the story is true, today's cockatrices breed true in terrifying and filthy dens haphazardly excavated by as many as a dozen of the squawking creatures. Males greatly outnumber females in these flocks, and are distinguished only by their wattles and combs. The typical cockatrice stands just over 2 feet high and weighs 5 pounds. While their diet consists primarily of seeds and petrified insects (which conveniently double in the creature's gizzard as both gastroliths and nutrition as they grind away), cockatrices fiercely defend their territories from anything they deem a threat, and the wanderings of rogue males seeking new spots to build dens sometimes bring them into unintentional contact with humanoids, with devastating results. The cockatrice's strange ability to turn other creatures to stone is the creature's greatest defense, and a cockatrice lair is invariably littered with petrified remnants of foes. In an ironic twist of fate, however, weasels and ferrets-the creatures most likely to slip into cockatrices' nests and consume their eggs-appear to be completely immune to the effect. For unknown reasons, cockatrices are both terrified of and enraged by conventional roosters, and are equally likely to flee or attack when confronted by one.\"},\n",

What few cyclopes survive seldom aspire higher than protecting their lairs and seeking out their next meals.

The average cyclops stands 9 feet tall and weighs 600 pounds. Both males and females are almost completely bald, with stringy patches of dark hair occasionally hanging down from above the ears. A bushy, expressive brow couples with a cyclops\\'s massive eye to make the creature\\'s attitude easily known. Cyclopean history is a vanishing thing inscribed on the crumbling walls of vine-choked lost cities that fell long before even the rise of the elves, when dragons and giants ruled a landscape unspoiled by the petty ephemeral races that rule today. Because things have fallen so far, a given cyclops is less likely to know the near-mythic triumphs of lost ages than even a semi-educated human. Ancient records, the oral traditions of other giantish races, and the scattered accounts of tribal natives of the southern jungles speak of much larger, more primal \"great cyclopes,\" imposing titans with shaggy legs and a massive horn above an inquisitive eye. These creatures are thought to have been either the leaders or the war beasts of the ancient race, and modern cyclopes honor them as elusive, destructive living gods.'},\n",

Endless layers of filthy, moldering black cloth shroud these small creatures, leading some to believe that the creature inside is smaller still. Usually encountered in groups, dark creepers flee from bright light, but are quite brave in the dark. Dark creepers stand just under 4 feet tall and weigh 80 pounds. Their flesh is pale and moist, and their eyes are milky white. Dark creepers exude a foul stench of sweat and spoiled food, owing primarily to the fact that they never take off their clothing-instead piling on new layers when the outermost one grows too ragged. For all the mayhem and trouble a pack of dark creepers can cause, this is nothing compared to the dangers a tribe led by the taller, even more sinister dark stalkers represents. Dark creepers treat their tall, lithe masters almost like gods, presenting them with offerings and obeying their every whim. Invariably, several dark stalkers serve as leaders to dark creeper tribes, with all of the tribe's heavy work and labor falling on the diminutive shoulders of the creepers, freeing the dark stalkers for their own decadent pleasures. Yet the dark creepers themselves see no inherent imbalance in this arrangement-to a dark creeper, a life in the servitude of a dark stalker is a life fulfilled.\"},\n",

Deep underground, these creatures dwell in strange villages (some rumors suggest entire cities) built of stone and fungus in remote caverns where they are served and worshiped by their coarser, diminutive kin, the dark creepers. Dark stalkers come to the surface rarely, but when they do it is on a mission, and with a force of creatures such that it never ends well for those they seek to rob or torment. Dark stalkers are tall, frail humanoids with incredibly pale skin. They constantly wear multiple layers of dark cloth and black leather armor, yet unlike their lesser kin, a dark stalker's garb is always clean and spotless. Each dark stalker carries a pair of short swords-they prefer these weapons to all others. Dark stalkers are 6 feet tall and weigh 100 pounds. In a fight, dark stalkers are not above sacrif icing lesser creatures, including dark creepers, to win the day or cover their retreat if things go poorly. They hate well-lit areas and always prefer to fight under the cover of deeper darkness. Dark stalkers rarely fight to the death if it can be avoided, preferring to slip away if things begin to look grim. The origins of the dark stalkers and the dark creepers are shrouded in mystery, made more difficult to decipher by the fact that the dark stalkers do not keep records of their history. Many scholars believe that, just as the drow descended from elves, so too must the dark folk have descended from humanity, their eerie powers and spell-like abilities the result of generation upon generation of devotion to profane and sinister magic. Alas, the truth of the race's history may never be known.\"},\n",

       "   'description': 'A darkmantle\\'s tentacle-span measures just under 5 feet-when attached to a cave roof and disguised as a stalactite, its length varies from 2 to 3 feet. A typical darkmantle weighs 40 pounds. The creatures\\' heads and bodies are usually the color of basalt or dark granite, but their webbed tentacles can change color to match their surroundings. The darkmantle isn\\'t a particularly good climber, but it can cling to a cave roof like a bat, hanging by the hooks at the ends of its tentacles so that its dangling body looks nearly indistinguishable from a stalactite. In this hidden position, the darkmantle waits for prey to pass beneath, at which point it drops and swoops down to attack its victim, slamming its body against the foe and attempting to wrap its webbed tentacles around the target. If the darkmantle misses its prey, it swoops back up and drops again until its prey is vanquished or the darkmantle is grievously injured (in which case the creature flutters back up to the roof to hide and hope its \"prey\" leaves it alone). The darkmantle\\'s inborn ability to cloak the area around it in magical darkness gives it an additional advantage over foes that rely upon light to see. Darkmantles prefer to dwell and hunt in the caves and passageways that are closest to the surface, as these tend to possess more traffic for the monsters to feed upon. Yet they do not confine themselves to these dark caverns, and can sometimes be found dwelling in ruined fortresses or even in the sewers of bustling cities. Anywhere food is plentiful and there\\'s a ceiling to cling to is a possible den for a darkmantle. A darkmantle\\'s life cycle is swift-young grow to maturity in a matter of months, and most die of old age after only a few years. As a result, generations of darkmantles quickly accrue, and over the years the evolution of these creatures is similarly swift. In this manner, a cavern\\'s ecosystem can have a signif icant effect on a group of darkmantles\\' appearance, abilities, and tactics. Aquatic caverns might develop darkmantles that can swim, while those beset with volcanism might generate darkmantles with a resistance to fire. Other darkmantle variants might develop much stonier hides, and instead of swooping down to crush prey might simply drop and pierce them through with their stalactite-like lengths. The deepest, darkest caverns are rumored to host darkmantles of incredible size, capable of smothering multiple human-sized foes at once in their leathery folds.'},\n",

Babaus obsess over the act of killing and take great pride in their grisly art, often leaving behind some form of grim marker or obscure signature, whether it be a distinctive modus operandi, an unnerving token, or other profane evidence. A babau typically carries a longspear or other weapon with which it can strike at foes beyond its normal reach, but given the opportunity, a babau prefers to fight with its teeth or claws. The foul, caustic sludge that constantly seeps from their flesh prevents them from wearing armor unless it is specially treated or resistant to acid. A babau is 6 feet tall but weighs only 140 pounds. They form from mortal souls of lone killers-those who, in life, took pleasure in more personal and intimate murders.

       "   'description': \"When folk whisper frightened tales of the demonic, what most envision is a towering figure of fire and flesh, a horned nightmare armed with flaming whip and sword flying through the night in search of its latest victim. The demon these folk fear is the balor, and that fear is justly placed, for few demons can match the mighty balor in strength or brutality. On the Abyss, most balors serve demon lords as generals or captains (those balors who don't are even more potent, and are known as balor lords-see below). A balor typically commands vast legions of demons, and while it often lets these slavering and eager minions fight its battles, the balor is far from a coward. If presented with an opportunity to join a fight, few balors choose to resist. In combat, a balor relies upon its spell-like abilities to fight foes wise enough to avoid melee range, favoring destructive powers like fire storm or implosion and saving dominate monster for use against the rare foe it would prefer to capture alive. A balor usually uses telekinesis to disarm ranged weapons or pull foes into melee-with the use of a quickened telekinesis, a balor can use the latter tactic and still inf lict a full-round attack on a hapless foe. A balor reduced to fewer than 50 hit points almost always seeks to flee via teleportation, but if that and flight prove impossible it seeks to position itself such that, if it is slain, its death throes are as devastating as possible to the enemy host. A balor stands 14 feet in height and weighs 4,500 pounds. Only the cruelest mortal souls can fuel the creation of a balor-unlike in the cases of most other demons, it often takes multiple souls of powerful villains to trigger the birthing of a new balor. Balor Lords Even more terrible than the typical balor are those who do not call a demon lord their master, but instead are masters themselves. A balor lord typically rules over a region no larger than half the size of the realm in which it resides (as only full demon lords can command the rule of an entire Abyssal realm), and even though most balor lords rule much smaller regions (generally areas comparable in size to a single continent), their power is vast indeed. A balor lord is typically a CR 21 to CR 25 monster (a range shared with the various unique nascent demon lords, with the range of CR 26 and above being the domain of the demon lords themselves), and as such serves quite well as the final villain in a long-running campaign. The majority of balor lords have several levels of barbarian, fighter, or ranger (although ranger balor lords never form bonds with animals), but some instead have levels of bard, rogue, sorcerer, or wizard. Cleric balor lords are unknown, as they see themselves as objects of worship, not the other way around, although rumors persist of powerful balor clerics that directly serve demon lords or even evil gods. In addition to any benefits a balor lord might gain from its class levels, all balor lords possess one additional unique ability over and above those granted by its race and class. Listed here are three sample balor lord abilities, but these samples are by no means the entirety of the strange powers a balor lord might wield. Lifedrinker (Su) Whenever the balor lord slays a living foe, it receives the benefits of a heal spell (CL 20th). This ability can activate up to once per round. Master of Magic (Su) The balor lord has additional spell-like abilities (20 spell levels' worth of 1st-4th level spells usable at will and 20 spell levels' worth of 5th-8th level spells usable 3 times a day). Soul Swallow (Su) As a standard action, the balor lord can inhale the soul of a living creature within 30 feet. The target must make a Fortitude save (DC 10 +1/2 balor lord's racial HD +the balor lord's Charisma modifier) or die. The body of a humanoid creature killed in this manner immediately transforms into a demon under the balor lord's command (a babau, succubus, or shadow demon, according to the balor lord's whim).\"},\n",

       "   'description': \"Even the lowest demons of the Abyss are dangerous and filled with a driving need to spread ruin and dismay. The lowly dretch is as hideous and foul as it is cruel, even if it lacks the strength and power to realize its need to brutalize others in its native realm. The lot of the dretch's existence is to serve more powerful demons as victims, and only the lucky few survive long enough to evolve. The dretch is a favorite target for dabblers in Abyssal summonings to call forth. Relatively weak and easy to bully, dretches can often be pressured into long periods of servitude with only vague promises of the opportunity to vent their frustrations and anger on softer foes. Yet the prospective dretch-summoner would do well to remember that these demons are as craven and untrustworthy as they come. A dretch faced with a more powerful foe is only too eager to trade what it knows for its pitiful excuse for a life. Unlike most demons, a dretch's slovenly personality and disdain for prolonged physical labor rarely result in success. Advanced dretches are rare, but those who do find it within themselves to be more than they were at creation often become the pauper-kings of the Abyss, cruel and bitter in their rule over vermin, broken souls, mindless undead, and other dretches. Their empires are confined to abandoned stretches of sewers under backwater cities, unstable reaches of swampland avoided by more sensible minds, and other undesirable corners of the Abyss that even demons find uncomfortable or foul. Yet to the dretch lords, these realms are their empires, and they defend them with a pitiful tenacity. A dretch stands 4 feet tall and weighs 180 pounds. Dretches typically form from the souls of slothful, evil mortals-yet it only takes a small fragment of a soul to trigger such a hideous birth. A single soul can often trigger the manifestation of a small army of dretches, and the sight of a horde of fresh-birthed dretches pulling free from the heaving protomatter of the Abyss is a nauseating and terrifying one indeed.\"},\n",

With its ability to cloak its true form in pleasant illusions, the glabrezu uses its magic to grant wishes to mortal humanoids as a method of rewarding those who succumb to its guile and deceit. A wish granted by a glabrezu always fulfills the wisher\\'s need in the most destructive way possible-although such methods might not be immediately apparent. A struggling weaponsmith might wish for fame and skill at his craft, only to find that his best patron is a cruel and sadistic murderer who uses the weapons to further his destructive desires.

A glabrezu stands 18 feet tall and weighs just over 6,000 pounds.

Long exposure to this corruption can cause vile transformations and hideous deformities. Often, entire backwater communities of deformed mutants owe their twisted countenances not as much to incest and poor breeding as they do to a hezrou's proximity. Although quite intelligent, a hezrou can fairly be said to waste its intellect. They prefer the simple pleasures-slumber, the thrill of torture, the bliss of feasting on a living meal, or the joy of feeling something beautiful breaking and crumbling in a clenched fist. They do not often seek to build empires or lead cults-although few hezrous would turn away prospective minions who came to serve the demon on their own. These monstrous and bestial creatures form from the souls of evil mortals who poisoned themselves, their kin, or their surroundings, such as drug addicts, assassins, and alchemists who cared not how their experiments polluted the environment.\"},\n",

       "   'description': \"Few demons understand the inner workings of the Abyss like the nalfeshnee, and it is not unusual to see a nalfeshnee seeming to serve the Abyss itself rather than a demon lord. Some claim stewardship over the fleshy realms that birth new demons, while others guard sites of particular significance deep in the plane's secret reaches. Often, a nalfeshnee's realm in the Abyss surpasses the strength and size of the largest of mortal kingdoms, for nalfeshnees display a singular gift for managing and ordering the chaos of the Abyss. Mortal summoners often seek them out for their unparalleled yet mad intellects, ever taking care to comb through bargains with such demons for hidden and unwanted consequences, for there is little a nalfeshnee will agree to do that does not, in some sinister way, advance the needs and desires of the Abyss. Nalfeshnees stand 20 feet tall and weigh 8,000 pounds. They form from the souls of greedy or avaricious evil mortals, particularly those who ruled over empires of slavery, theft, banditry, and more violent vices.\"},\n",

A quasit\\'s first role in life is that of a familiar to a spellcasting master, but those quasits who escape from this humiliating servitude become free-willed and much more dangerous. A typical quasit stands a foot and a half tall, and weighs only 8 pounds. Alone among the demonic horde, quasits do not form from the dead souls of evil mortals. Instead, they form from living souls-when a spellcaster seeks out a quasit to serve him as a familiar, his soul brushes against the Abyss and it reacts, carving from itself a quasit linked to that spellcaster\\'s soul and forming a powerful bond between the two. Newly created quasits are birthed directly into the Material Plane, where they become familiars, and while bonded to their masters\\' wills, all quasits hate and loathe their lieges, as they can feel the pulse of their lords\\' souls and know that they could have been more. A quasit serves, yet it watches and waits for mistakes that might cost its master\\'s life, or even better, an error that might let the quasit turn against its master. When a quasit\\'s master dies, the quasit can attempt to follow the master\\'s soul into the Great Beyond by making a DC 15 Will save. This functions as plane shift, but affects only the quasit and transports it into the Abyss and places its master\\'s soul in the quasit\\'s possession as a writhing larvae rather than using the evil master\\'s soul to create new demonic life. In this manner, a quasit can use its newly captured soul to bargain with more powerful denizens of the lower planes, and perhaps secure a vile transformative \"promotion\" to a more powerful form of life in the process. Rarely, a quasit elects to ignore its master\\'s death and instead remains on the Material Plane to seek other ways to entertain itself-usually settling in an urban area where there are plenty of folk to torment.'},\n",

Derros often abduct surface dwellers to perform hideous experiments on them in their neverending quest to divine what protects those who dwell above from the burning death, yet the intrinsic madness that plagues all derros dooms these experiments to failure every time. In the end, traumatized victims are returned to their homes, memories not quite completely wiped of their ordeal, to live the rest of their lives in vague fear of a nightmare they can't quite recall. A typical derro fights with a short sword or a repeating light crossbow with plenty of poison bolts. Some derros also carry an aklys-a hooked throwing club attached to a 20-footlong cord. This cord limits the club's range, but allows the derro to retrieve it as a moveequivalent action after it has been thrown. Derro leaders are typically sorcerers of at least 3rd level, although they also make excellent rogues. Many derros wield strange and unusual weapons like hooked polearms, eerie whistling aklyses, long hollow spears that can be filled with toxins, or crystalline throwing wedges that shatter on impact to create horrif ic bleeding wounds.

Barbazus are fond of making charge attacks with their glaives, and try to maintain a 10-foot gap between themselves and their foes so they can use their signature polearms to great effect. Against a foe that has greater reach (or one able to otherwise avoid the devil's favored tactic), they drop their glaives and resort to their claws and hideous beards.

Born of ancient heresies mired amid the Styx-fed swamps of Stygia, Hell's fifth layer, bone devils-also known as osyluths-enforce infernal order and the will of the archdevils. Powerful fiends favor these terrifying sadists for their unwavering devotion to Hell's laws and the commands of their masters, as osyluths eagerly report the disobedience of other devils-regardless of standing-and take to the craft of torture like morbid artists. Diabolists risk much to bargain with them, as bone devils glean many infernal secrets amid their nightmarish calcified torture hives. These devils especially delight in journeying to the mortal plane, as their cruel talents and service to evil spellcasters often mean gaining much valuable information, which they might hold in their perfect memories for centuries before reporting back to their diabolical masters. In battle, an osyluth uses quickened invisibility after each attack to confuse foes. Many osyluths carry twisted and eerie bone weapons, but these tools are more for torture and intimidation than actual combat. Osyluths tower over lesser devils at 9 feet tall-though their tails and fearsome but useless wings make them appear much larger-and weigh upward of 400 pounds.\"},\n",

Executioners, not judges, erinyes alight upon the bladed eaves of Dis, Hell's cosmopolitan second layer, ever attentive for chances to soar into battle, whether in defense of Hell, on the whims of diabolical masters, or at the impassioned summons of jilted mortal summoners. All erinyes weave deadly living ropes from their own hair, which they use in battle to lift their foes into the air, mocking and condemning their victims for their transgressions before dropping them from great heights. Erinyes appear as darkly beautiful angels, augmenting their sensuality with deliberate bruises and scars. Yet despite their beauty, erinyes are not seducers-they lack the subtlety and patience required for such fine emotional manipulations, and instead vastly prefer to solve their problems with swift and excruciating violence. Often, an erinyes will stay her hand before attempting to slay a foe simply so she can draw out the victim's suffering. Death is usually the only way to escape an erinyes's not-so-tender attentions, and the most powerful of these devils excel at keeping their enemies alive but helpless so as to extend their torment-many going as far as to keep their victims alive with magic. Rumors hold that the most powerful erinyes torturers have skills that allow their torment to continue even after their subject has died from their attentions. Most erinyes stand just under 6 feet tall and weigh approximately 140 pounds, even with their blackfeathered wings that stretch over 10 feet wide.\"},\n",

Born on the icy layer of Cocytus, Hell's seventh layer, most ice devils migrate to Caina, the eighth layer, where they plot world-damning machinations from courts of freezing steel. Although they are perhaps the most alien and monstrous in appearance of all devils, few breeds are accorded greater respect. In combat, a gelugon prefers to let its minions engage foes in melee so that it can hang back and appraise the foe's tactics, strengths, and weaknesses. The ice devil supports its minions with its spell-like abilities, always taking care to avoid impacting its minions in the area of effect of its spells-this not from any sense of camaraderie, only a cold and logical truth that its allies can survive longer in a fight if they are not exposed to friendly fire.

       "   'description': \"Born directly from the pits of Hell, imps are among the least of the true devils; these vicious, manipulative fiends, however, hold an important role in the corruption of mortal souls. Unfettered from the ranks and duties of diabolical armies, imps delight in any opportunity to travel to the Material Plane and subtly tempt mortals toward acts of ever-greater depravity. Willingly serving spellcasters as familiars, imps play the role of dutiful servants, often granting their masters cunning advice and infernal insights. In truth, though, an imp works to deliver souls to Hell, assuring that its master's soul-and as many collateral souls as possible-faces damnation upon death. Imps vary widely in appearance, ranging through a spectrum of bestial traits and grotesque body shapes, though most take the forms of red-skinned, winged humanoids with bulbous features. Such a typical imp stands a mere 2 feet tall, has a 3-foot wingspan, and weighs 10 pounds. One in every thousand imps possesses the ability to communicate telepathically with creatures within 50 feet and the power to change its form into that of any Small or Tiny animal, as per the spell beast shape II. These imp consulars are highly prized by powerful devils, who send them to serve their favored minions or to corrupt mortals with great destinies. An imp consular can be summoned via the Improved Familiar feat, but only by a spellcaster of 8th level or higher. Diabolists tell of other breeds of imps with similarly specialized abilities, but if such creatures truly exist they are an especially rare lot. Unlike most devils, imps often find themselves free and alone on the Material Plane, particularly after they've been summoned to serve as familiars and their masters have perished (often indirectly due to the machinations of the imp itself ). With no way to return home, these imps, freed of their bonds to arcane masters, can become dangerous pests or even leaders of small tribes of savage humanoids like goblins or kobolds.\"},\n",

       "   'description': \"The least of devilkind, lemures roil forth from the ranks of souls damned to Hell, shapeless masses of quivering flesh. What spark of instinct or memory lingers on within a lemure's semi-consciousness regularly shapes its features to mimic those of its tormentors or the tortured souls around it. Grotesque and useless, a lemure's features speak nothing of what it once was. Many exhibit multiple terrible visages or are nothing more than churning pillars of cancerous flesh. Only their knobby, flailing limbs work as they should, and those they merely use to destroy any non-infernal life that draws too near. Moving lemures typically congeal in forms over 4 feet tall and weigh upward of 200 pounds, though when at rest these disgusting fiends often appear to be little more than lumps of melted flesh and malformed features. Although among the most loathsome creatures in existence, lemures serve a vital role in Hell's perverse ecology. When at the end of a mortal life a creature's soul is damned-whether because it revered diabolical forces or failed in the worship of another deity-it joins the masses of suffering souls filling the plains of Avernus, Hell's first layer. Here a soul's torments begin as lesser devils marshal it along with similar spirits in preparation for a long, perilous journey to one of Hell's deeper layers-typically one suited to the punishments appropriate to the soul's crimes, or merely the domain of a devil who has need for slaves. Upon reaching the realm of their damnation, souls face untold lifetimes of torment at the hands of devils, other fiendish beings, and the deadly machinations of Hell itself. As the formerly mortal essences slowly go mad, they forget their lives, grow bestial, and eventually become little more than automatons of fear and hatred. After ages of such existence, the cruel processes of Hell either utterly annihilate the soul or-in the cases of the most profane spirits-reconsecrate such forsaken beings into lemures, the building blocks of devils, unthinking waves of filth and diabolical flesh. Such repulsive beings assemble in vast mobs, waves of putrescence thousands upon thousands strong. Greater devils can spot the most corrupt of these fiends and, either through mysterious tortures or the powers of Hell itself, reshape them into true devils, newly born and ready to obediently serve in the legions of the damned.\"},\n",

       "   'description': \"Rulers of infernal realms, generals of Hell's armies, and advisors to the archf iends, pit fiends embody the awesome and terrible pinnacle of devilkind. Massive, physically indomitable, and possessed of ingenious evil intellects, these diabolical tyrants hold great autonomy whether in their service to the archf iends, in their rule of vast infernal fiefdoms, or in subjugation of mortal worlds. Thick muscles cling to their gigantic frames, armored over by dense, bladed scales capable of def lecting all but the most potent assaults. Fangs as thick as daggers fill their maws, bestial visages disguising some of the most insidious minds in Hell. Born within the depths of Nessus, the ninth and deepest layer of Hell, pit fiends are raised from the ranks of cornugons and gelugons by the archdevils and their dukes alone. While many travel to higher layers and far from Hell to command infernal legions, most remain in Nessus serving in the courts of Hell's elite or in dark councils with unknowable purposes. Pit fiends always stand over 14 feet tall, with wingspans in excess of 20 feet and weights over 1,000 pounds. Pit fiends are masters of fire and prefer lands bathed in flame. In Hell, this predisposes them to Avernus, Dis, Malebolge, Nessus, and Phlegethon the layers most likely to harbor their burning temple-citadels. Fanatics obsessed with diabolical superiority and ironclad obedience, pit fiends left to their own devices raise massive armies, scouring the pits of Hell for the most depraved lemures to transform into true fiends. When convinced they've formed the perfect legions, they turn their attentions to vulnerable demiplanes and mortal worlds, eyeing them for infernal domination and the glory of conquest. In the service of the archfiends or other unique infernal warlords, pit fiends hold themselves to a greater cause, obeying the wills of Asmodeus's chosen nobles in the hopes of one day garnering the favor of either the Prince of Darkness or Hell itself. While obedient to the hierarchies of their kind, they are also strict in their enforcement, and should a pit fiend find itself subservient to a master unfit to rule, it holds itself duty bound to cast down such an incompetent lord. Thus, whether as masters or servants, pit fiends embody the will of Hell's merciless law and assure that only the strongest of devilkind flourish (or dare to). Only the most powerful of mortal spellcasters can or dare summon a pit fiend. These devils' reactions to summoning are deliberate and swift, usually typified by overwhelming rage that such insignificant beings would waste their immortal time. Those that cannot weather the devils' burning rage are slain-their souls typically racing the pit fiends back to Hell. Those who manage to keep control of the greater devils, though, intrigue them. A pit fiend might dutifully serve a mortal master for centuries, but its goal is always the same: to further corrupt the mortal soul, assure its absolute damnation, and when the mortal inevitably dies, claim its soul and begin the process of creating a perfectly corrupt lemure servant. Pit fiends know they are immortal and are intelligent enough to indulge in impossibly disciplined patience. As such, the eldest pit fiends see in their legions the faces of countless fools who once presumed themselves the devils' masters. Infernal Dukes The most powerful of pit fiends are lords in their own right-members of the elite caste of infernal politics and leadership known as the Dukes of Hell. While not all of the Dukes of Hell are pit fiends, the majority of them are. As a general rule, a pit fiend Duke of Hell has several levels of a particular character class, the advanced simple template, or in some cases unusual spell-like abilities or unique powers over and above those of most pit fiends. Listed here are three sample unique pit fiend duke abilities, but these examples are by no means the entirety of what strange powers an infernal duke might wield. Deathmastery (Su): The pit fiend duke's ability to manipulate the souls of the damned extends beyond the standard devil shaping power. Whenever a pit fiend slays a humanoid, it can attempt to transform the slain creature's soul into a ghost under the pit fiend's control. The pit fiend may control a number of ghosts in this manner equal to its Charisma modifier. Master of Magic (Su): The pit fiend duke has additional spell-like abilities (20 spell levels' worth of 1st-4th level spells usable at will and 20 spell levels' worth of 5th-8th level spells usable 3 times a day). Hellfire Breath (Su): The pit fiend gains a devastating breath weapon that it can use once every 1d4 rounds. This breath weapon is a 60-foot cone of fire (10d10 fire damage and 10d10 unholy damage as per flame strike, successful Ref lex save [DC 10 +1/2 the pit fiend's racial HD +the pit fiend's Constitution modifier] half ).\"},\n",

In its natural form, the creature looks more or less humanoid, but slender and frail, with gangly limbs and half-formed facial features. Its flesh is pale and hairless, and its eyes are vacant and white. Doppelgangers prefer infiltrating societies where they can gather wealth and inf luence, and see little point in forming cities of their own kind. Younger doppelgangers practice their skills by taking over small orc or goblin tribes, then move to more complicated societies like dwarven, elven, and human communities. Rather than making themselves targets by taking positions of leadership, they prefer to be the power behind the throne, or use multiple identities to manipulate inf luential citizens or entire guilds. Doppelgangers make excellent use of their natural mimicry to stage ambushes, bait traps, and infiltrate humanoid society. Although not usually evil, they are interested only in themselves and regard all others as playthings to be manipulated and deceived. They are particularly fond of invading human societies in order to indulge in their desires-some enjoy the complex dance of politics while others seek constant change in the race and gender of both themselves and their romantic companions. While not standard, it is those doppelgangers use their gifts for cruel and sadistic purposes that are most notorious, and these shapeshifters are the primary cause of the race's sinister reputation. Certainly, a creature capable of changing its shape has a handy way to avoid capture for its crimes, and some particularly malicious doppelgangers enjoy disrupting relationships by posing as unfaithful lovers. Rumors persist of even more powerful doppelgangers capable of not only shifting their appearance, but also skills, memories, and even the extraordinary and supernatural abilities of creatures whose forms they choose to mimic. These doppelgangers' change shape ability functions like the spell polymorph rather than alter self.\"},\n",

       "   'description': \"Dragon turtles make their homes in both salt and fresh water, where they rank among the biggest threats to sailors and those who travel by ship through the waterways of the world. Skilled mariners know the territory dragon turtles claim and frequently make offerings of gold and magic for safe passage or avoid the area entirely. For its part, a dragon turtle quickly grows to appreciate and even expect such tithes and gifts, and a dragon turtle that expects gifts but is ignored is a dangerous foe indeed. A dragon turtle's shell varies in color between individuals. Some have dull shells of brown and rust red, while others have carapaces of a deep green-blue color with silver highlights across the rocky ridges. The coloration of the head, tail, and legs is slightly paler than the shell and contains golden streaks along the crest and spines. Dragon turtles claim vast territories in the open seas, encompassing regions often in excess of 50 square miles. Here, these dangerous beasts capsize ships that fail to respect their territories, adding the sunken wrecks and their valuable cargoes to their lairs. Dragon turtles generally make their homes in deep caves only accessible through the water, and often decorate their lairs not only with the wealth seized from ships they've sunk, but the wrecks of these unfortunate ships themselves. Their territorial natures and fondness for these types of lairs put them in direct conf lict with other undersea races such as merfolk and sahuagin. Large fish, such as tuna, sturgeons, and even sharks, rank among dragon turtles' favorite foods, but being omnivores, they also sometimes feed on large undersea fields of seaweed. They certainly aren't above supplementing their diets with the passengers of ships they sink, although such feeding is not borne of any intrinsic evil or cruelty. Dragon turtles possess shells 15 feet in diameter, with their appendages stretching a few feet further, and measure over 25 feet long from the tip of their noses to the ends of their powerful tails.\"},\n",

Drow have dark skin, ranging from black to a hazy purple hue. Most drow have white or silver hair and white or red eyes, but other colors are not unheard of. Drow society is ruled over by powerful nobility, themselves governed by sadistic and dangerous matriarchs who constantly plot and scheme against rival houses and lesser kin within their own families. The majority of drow are the common soldiers and decadent citizenry, with base stats as presented here-drow nobles are more powerful and dangerous, and are detailed on the facing page. In combat, drow are thoroughly ruthless, with little regard for fairness or mercy. They prefer to attack from ambush or to lure enemies into situations where they clearly have the upper hand. If things turn against them, drow are quick to flee, leaving slaves and minions to cover their escape. Drow Characters Drow are defined by their class levels-they do not possess racial Hit Dice. All drow have the following racial traits. +2 Dexterity, +2 Charisma, -2 Constitution: Drow are nimble and manipulative. Medium: Drow are Medium creatures, and have no bonuses or penalties due to their size. Normal Speed: Drow have a base speed of 30 feet. Darkvision: Drow can see in the dark up to 120 feet. Drow Immunities: Drow are immune to magic sleep effects and get a +2 racial bonus to saves against enchantment spells. Keen Senses: Drow receive a +2 racial bonus on Perception checks. Spell Resistance: Drow possess spell resistance equal to 6 plus their class levels. Spell-Like Abilities: A drow can cast dancing lights, darkness, and faerie fire each once per day, using his total character level as his caster level. Light Blindness: Abrupt exposure to bright light blinds drow for 1 round; on subsequent rounds, they are dazzled as long as they remain in the affected area. Poison Use: See Special Abilities, above. Weapon Familiarity: Drow are proficient with the hand crossbow, rapier, and short sword. Languages: Drow begin play speaking Elven and Undercommon. Drow with high Intelligence can choose bonus languages from the following: Abyssal, Aklo, Aquan, Common, Draconic, Drow Sign Language, Gnome, or Goblin.

Duergar dwell in communities deep underground, and appear as darker, more twisted versions of their kinder kin. Their skin is a dull gray, as though rubbed with dust or ash, but this is a natural coloration that better allows them to blend with their underground surroundings. They are a race of slavers, but while non-dwarven prisoners are usually put to backbreaking work, dwarven prisoners are generally slain on the spot. In combat, duergar fire crossbows from a distance, then shift to the warhammer after a few rounds. If outnumbered, or given sufficient threat (and space), a duergar will use its enlarge person ability and begin lashing out at its enemies. Duergar Characters Duergar are defined by their class levels-they do not possess racial Hit Dice. All duergar have the following racial traits. +2 Constitution, +2 Wisdom, -4 Charisma: Duergar are hearty and observant, but also stubborn and belligerent. Slow and Steady: Duergar have a base speed of 20 feet, but their speed is never modified by armor or encumbrance. Darkvision: Duergar can see in the dark up to 120 feet. Duergar Immunities: Duergar are immune to paralysis, phantasms, and poison. They also gain a +2 racial bonus on saving throws against spells and spell-like abilities. Stability: Duergar receive a +4 racial bonus to their CMD against bull rush or trip attempts while on solid ground. Spell-Like Abilities: Duergar can cast enlarge person and invisibility each once per day, using their character level as their caster level. Both of these spell-like abilities affect the duergar only. Light Sensitivity: Duergar are dazzled as long as they remain in an area of bright light. Languages: Duergar begin play speaking Common, Dwarven, and Undercommon.

A body of water is an impassible barrier unless the fire elemental can step or jump over it or the water is covered with a flammable material (such as a layer of oil). Fire elementals vary in appearance-they usually manifest as coiling serpentine forms made of smoke and lame, but some fire elementals take on shapes more akin to humans, demons, or other monsters in order to increase the terror of their sudden appearance. Features on a fire elemental's body are made by darker bits of flame or patches of semi-stable smoke, ash, and cinders. Elemental Height Weight Small 4 ft. 1 lb. Medium 8 ft. 2 lbs.

Ettercaps are known for building cunning traps out of webs and other natural materials, using them to trap prey. They build shelters out of webbing, often high up in the trees away from other ground-based predators, and use monstrous spiders as lookouts and guardians. Ettercaps are not brave creatures, but their traps often ensure that the enemy never draws a weapon. When an ettercap does engage its enemies, it attacks with its claws and venomous bite. It usually refuses to come within melee reach of any foe that is still able to move, and flees if an opponent gets free.'},\n",

They have pinkish-brown skin, but ettins never bathe if they can help it, which usually leaves them so grimy and dirty their skin resembles thick, gray hide. Adult ettins are about 13 feet tall and weigh 5,200 pounds. They live about 75 years. Ettins have no language of their own but speak a pidgin of Giant, Goblin, and Orc. Creatures that can speak any of these languages must succeed on a DC 15 Intelligence check to communicate with an ettin. Check once for each bit of information: if the other creature speaks two of these languages, the DC is 10, and for someone who speaks all three, the DC is 5. Though ettins aren't very intelligent, they are cunning fighters. They prefer to ambush their victims rather than charge into a fight, but once the battle has started, an ettin fights furiously until all enemies are dead. Ettins lead solitary lives, establishing lairs in secluded rocky caves and hollows, often surrounded by pits and trenches. Ettins sometimes keep cave bears as pets and guardians for their lairs. A particularly powerful ettin may attract a gang of a few followers, possibly with several goblin or orc allies. Such gatherings are the exception rather than the rule, however, and seldom last long, with individual ettins going their separate ways when opportunities for pillage and plunder decrease or if the leader is killed. Mated couples usually come together to breed for only a short time before going off on their own again. Young ettins mature quickly, reaching adult size within a year, when they are kicked out to fend for themselves.\"},\n",

       "   'description': 'A hardy plant that grows in areas with poor soil but abundant animal life, this dangerous predator is an immense version of its more common (and much smaller) kin. Whereas the smaller flytraps supplement their growth by catching insects, the giant flytrap does the same with animals, humanoids, and anything else foolish enough to draw too near. Local legends call this plant names like \"mancatcher,\" \"snapperjaw plant,\" \"dragonleaf plant,\" \"cowbiter,\" and \"green gulper,\" but adventurers know it simply as the giant flytrap. As the giant flytrap\\'s prey are generally much smarter than insects, this huge plant has evolved into a much more aggressive hunter than its smaller brethren. It can lumber slowly along the ground, using its writhing roots like tentacles to relocate to more populous hunting grounds, and is quite canny at blending in with the surrounding foliage. A giant flytrap\\'s jaws and stalks are swift-moving-it reaches out and snaps at passersby with lightning speed. The plant itself even has a modicum of intelligence, and is capable of limited tactical choices, such as knowing when to break off an attack against a powerful foe. While most giant flytraps have four sets of jaws, some can have as few as one, and others eight or more. As a general rule, you should increase a giant flytrap\\'s HD by 2 and its natural armor bonus by +1 for each additional bite attack you give it, increasing its CR by +1 for each time you increase its attacks and HD in this manner. If you increase the plant by more than 3 or 4 bites (and thus by more than 6 or 8 Hit Dice), consult Table 1-1 on page 291 to make sure that the plant\\'s CR remains appropriate. A giant flytrap\\'s stalks are 20 feet long, but generally sprawl relatively close to the central mass-a set of full-grown flytrap jaws is 7 feet across. A giant flytrap weighs 9,000 pounds.'},\n",

Capable of catching and eating dinosaurs and even dragons, the froghemoth is a frighteningly effective ambush hunter. When lying in wait for prey, the immense creature secrets itself in deep marsh pools and mud so that only the top of its eyestalk emerges from the surface. The froghemoth\\'s eyes are incredibly keen, but even more impressive is the monster\\'s tongue. Like a snake, a froghemoth can \"taste\" its surroundings with extraordinary accuracy. Scholars have long debated the origin of this strangely immense predator, arguing that its unusual senses, physiology, and resistances make it something more than an animal. Druids and other servants of the natural world agree-the froghemoth may act like an animal, but it never seems fully \"comfortable\" in its environs. Perpetually illtempered, a froghemoth often seems to kill simply for the sake of killing-vomiting up partially digested meals in favor of new prey when it encounters such. It\\'s not unheard of to find these strange creatures far from their normal habitations, as if the marsh didn\\'t agree with them and sent them wandering in search of a new home. Some sages argue that the froghemoth isn\\'t from this world at all, and that these wanderings are instinctual urges to seek out its true home-a home not represented by the strange world in which the beast finds itself trapped.

Gargoyles tend toward obsessive-compulsive behaviors that are as varied as their kind is plentiful. Books, stolen trinkets, weapons, and grisly trophies harvested from fallen foes are just a few examples of the types of things a gargoyle might collect to decorate its lair and territory. Gargoyles tend toward a solitary lifestyle, though they sometimes form fearsome groups called \"wings\" for protection and sport. In certain conditions, a tribe of gargoyles might even ally with other creatures, but even the most stable alliances with a gargoyle tribe can collapse for the smallest of reasons-gargoyles are nothing if not treacherous, petty, and vindictive. Gargoyles have been known to dwell in the heart of the largest of cities, crouching amid the decorations of stone cathedrals and buildings where they hide in plain sight by day and swoop down to feed on vagabonds, beggars, and other unfortunates at night. The longer a tribe of gargoyles abides in a region of ruins or buildings, the more its members come to resemble that region\\'s architectural styles. The changes a gargoyle\\'s appearance undergoes are slow and subtle, but over the course of years, it can shift radically. One unusual variant of gargoyle dwells not amid buildings and ruins but under the waves of the sea. These creatures are known as kapoacinths-they have the same basic statistics as normal gargoyles, save that they have the aquatic subtype and their wings grant them a swim speed of 60 feet (but are useless for actual flight). Kapoacinths dwell in shallow, coastal regions where they can shamble up from the surf to prey on those that reside there. They are more likely to form wings, as kapoacinths prefer group living to a solitary lifestyle.'},\n",

Materials the cube cannot digest, such as metal and stone, can eventually fill up the creature's mass with such detritus, and at times the creature may excrete some of this material out of its body. Often the treasure and possessions of past victims remain inside the gelatinous cube, leaving a ghostly impression of their material remains. Sages believe these creatures evolved as a specialized advancement of gray oozes. Some beings use gelatinous cubes as protectors of dungeons and underground fortifications, trapping the immense creatures in massive metal crates and transporting them through either slave power or magic to their final guard posts. They make particularly efficient waste disposal mechanisims as well-a tribe that can trap a gelatinous cube in a pit or other area that it cannot climb out of can use it as a midden or even a deadly trap, depending only on the ingenuity of the creatures who caught it. Gelatinous cubes are generally 10 feet to a side and weigh upward of 15,000 pounds, though subterranean explorers report larger specimens trawling the deepest caves and corridors. In locations with plentiful sources of food, gelatinous cubes can exist for hundreds of years, if not thousands. However, if denied organic material for more than 6 months, a gelatinous cube begins shrinking. Eventually this stresses its walls and the creature leaks rapidly evaporating slimy liquid until its body collapses and disappears completely.\"},\n",

A djinni overmatched in combat usually takes flight and becomes a whirlwind to harass those who follow. When faced with Gelatinous C Gelatinous Cube-Genie, Djinni no other option than melee combat, most djinn prefer to wield masterwork scimitars two-handed. Among other genies, djinn get along well with jann and marids. They are frequently at odds with the shaitans, and are sworn enemies of the efreet, despising these fiery genies more than any other genie race. So legendary is the conf lict between the efreet and the djinn that many spellcasters attempt (to varying degrees of success) to secure a djinni's servitude by promising to aid the cause against their hated enemies. A small percentage of djinn are noble. Noble djinn, often called viziers, have 10 Hit Dice, Strength 23, and Charisma 17, and can grant three wishes to any being (nongenies only) who captures them.

A janni is human-sized, standing about 6 feet tall and weighing about 180 pounds. Jann are physically strong and courageous, and do not take kindly to insult or injury. Most are quite prone to seeing insult even when none is intended by the speaker. If overwhelmed in battle, they escape using flight and invisibility, returning later with reinforcements. Jann enjoy their privacy, preferring the solitude of the deep desert and isolated oases. They are usually suspicious of humans, but are often willing to give them the benefit of the doubt. Jann have a strong cultural tradition of hospitality, and will never turn away someone in need of food, water, or shelter, though they might expect payment in the form of a favor at some later date. Among the other genie races, jann generally have good relations with both djinn and shaitans. While not actively enemies, jann dislike the proud and aloof marids. Jann have a distinct aversion to the efreet, who often try to enslave them or conscript them into their armies. A small percentage of jann are noble.

       "   'description': 'When a soul is not allowed to rest due to some great injustice, either real or perceived, it sometimes comes back as a ghost. Such beings are in eternal anguish, lacking in substance and unable to set things right. Although ghosts can be any alignment, the majority cling to the living world out of a powerful sense of rage and hatred, and as a result are chaotic evil-even the ghost of a good or lawful creature can become hateful and cruel in its afterlife. More than most of the monsters in this book, a ghost benefits from a strong and detailed backstory. Why did this character become a ghost? What are the legends surrounding the ghost? An encounter with a ghost should never happen completely out of the blue-there are plenty of other incorporeal undead like wraiths and spectres to fill that role. A proper encounter with a ghost should be a climactic scene after a lengthy period of tension building with lesser minions or manifestations of the undead spirit. The sample ghost above is that of a human princess who was murdered by an unfaithful lover-after she confronted him, he murdered her by wrapping her in chains and throwing her into the castle well, where she drowned. The ghost\\'s abilities were selected to fit this backstory, and it shows how potent a villain you can create with a simple NPC class. Applying the template to creatures with class levels or creatures with significant racial abilities can create even more powerful ghosts. When a ghost is created, it retains incorporeal \"copies\" of any items that it particularly valued in life (provided the originals are not in another creature\\'s possession). The equipment works normally for the ghost but passes harmlessly through material objects or creatures. A weapon of +1 or better magical enhancement, however, can harm material creatures, but any such attack deals only half as much damage (50%) unless it is a ghost touch weapon. A ghost can use shields or armor only if they have the ghost touch quality. The original items remain behind, just as the ghost\\'s physical remains do. If another creature seizes the original, the incorporeal copy fades away. This loss invariably angers the ghost, who stops at nothing to return the item to its original resting place (and thus regain the item\\'s use). Creating a Ghost \"Ghost\" is an acquired template that can be added to any living creature that has a Charisma score of at least 6. A ghost retains all the base creature\\'s statistics and special abilities except as noted here. Challenge Rating: Same as the base creature +2. Type: The creature\\'s type changes to undead. Do not recalculate the creature\\'s base attack bonus, saves, or skill points. It gains the incorporeal subtype. Armor Class: A ghost gains a def lection bonus equal to its Charisma modifier. It loses the base creature\\'s natural armor bonus, as well as all armor and shield bonuses not from force effects or ghost touch items. Hit Dice: Change all of the creature\\'s racial Hit Dice to d8s. All Hit Dice derived from class levels remain unchanged. Ghosts use their Charisma modifiers to determine bonus hit points (instead of Constitution). Defensive Abilities: A ghost retains all of the defensive abilities of the base creature save those that rely on a corporeal form to function. Ghosts gain channel resistance +4, darkvision 60 ft., the incorporeal ability, and all of the immunities granted by its undead traits. Ghosts also gain the rejuvenation ability. Rejuvenation (Su): In most cases, it\\'s difficult to destroy a ghost through simple combat: the \"destroyed\" spirit restores itself in 2d4 days. Even the most powerful spells are usually only temporary solutions. The only way to permanently destroy a ghost is to determine the reason for its existence and set right whatever prevents it from resting in peace. The exact means varies with each spirit and may require a good deal of research, and should be created specifically for each different ghost by the GM. Speed: Ghosts lose their previous speeds and gain a fly speed of 30 feet (perfect), unless the base creature has a higher fly speed. Melee and Ranged Attacks: A ghost loses all of the base creature\\'s attacks. If it could wield weapons in life, it can wield ghost touch weapons as a ghost. Special Attacks: A ghost retains all the special attacks of the base creature, but any relying on physical contact do not function. In addition, a ghost gains one ghost special attack from the list below for every 3 points of CR (minimum 1-the first ability chosen must always be corrupting touch). The save DC against a ghost\\'s special attack is equal to 10 +1/2 ghost\\'s HD +ghost\\'s Charisma modifier unless otherwise noted. Additional ghost abilities beyond these can be designed at the GM\\'s discretion. Corrupting Gaze (Su): The ghost is disfigured through age or violence, and has a gaze attack with a range of 30 feet that causes 2d10 damage and 1d4 Charisma damage (Fortitude save negates Charisma damage but not physical damage). Corrupting Touch (Su): All ghosts gain this incorporeal touch attack. By passing part of its incorporeal body through a foe\\'s body as a standard action, the ghost inf licts a number of d6s equal to its CR in damage. This damage is not negative energy-it manifests in the form of physical wounds and aches from supernatural aging. Creatures immune to magical aging are immune to this damage, but otherwise the damage bypasses all forms of damage reduction. A Fortitude save halves the damage inf licted. Draining Touch (Su): The ghost died while insane or diseased. It gains a touch attack that drains 1d4 points from any one ability score it selects on a hit. On each such successful attack, the ghost heals 5 points of damage to itself. When a ghost makes a draining touch attack, it cannot use its standard ghostly touch attack. Frightful Moan (Su): The ghost died in the throes of crippling terror. It can emit a frightful moan as a standard action. All living creatures within a 30-foot spread must succeed on a Will save or become panicked for 2d4 rounds. This is a sonic mind-affecting fear effect. A creature that successfully saves against the moan cannot be affected by the same ghost\\'s moan for 24 hours. Malevolence (Su): The ghost\\'s jealousy of the living is particularly potent. Once per round, the ghost can merge its body with a creature on the Material Plane. This ability is similar to a magic jar spell (caster level 10th or the ghost\\'s Hit Dice, whichever is higher), except that it does not require a receptacle. To use this ability, the ghost must be adjacent to the target. The target can resist the attack with a successful Will save. A creature that successfully saves is immune to that same ghost\\'s malevolence for 24 hours. Telekinesis (Su): The ghost\\'s death involved great physical trauma. The ghost can use telekinesis as a standard action once every 1d4 rounds (caster level 12th or equal to the ghost\\'s HD, whichever is higher). Abilities: Cha +4; as an incorporeal undead creature, a ghost has no Strength or Constitution score. Skills: Ghosts have a +8 racial bonus on Perception and Stealth skill checks. A ghost always treats Climb, Disguise, Fly, Intimidate, Knowledge (arcana), Knowledge (religion), Perception, Sense Motive, Spellcraft, and Stealth as class skills. Otherwise, skills are the same as the base creature.'},\n",

Legends hold that the first ghouls were either cannibalistic humans whose unnatural hunger dragged them back from death or humans who in life fed on the rotting remains of their kin and died (and were reborn) from the foul disease-the true source of these undead scavengers is unclear. Ghouls lurk on the edges of civilization (in or near cemeteries or in city sewers) where they can find ample supplies of their favorite food. Though they prefer rotting bodies and often bury their victims for a while to improve their taste, they eat fresh kills if they are hungry enough. Though most surface ghouls live primitively, rumors speak of ghoul cities deep underground led by priests who worship ancient cruel gods or strange demon lords of hunger. These \"civilized\" ghouls are no less horrific in their eating habits, and in fact the concept of a welllaid ghoul banquet table is perhaps even more horrifying than the concept of taking a meal fresh from the coffin. Ghast Ghasts are ghouls with the advanced monster template. A ghast\\'s paralysis even affects elves. Ghasts roam in packs of their own kind or lead groups of common ghouls. The stink of death and corruption surrounding these creatures is overwhelming, granting them the stench extraordinary ability (10-foot radius, Fort DC 15 negates, sickened for 1d6+4 minutes).

The better the clothes and the finer the jewelry, the more important the wearer. They also appreciate music, and most can play one or more instruments (the harp is a favorite). Cloud giants have an unusually wide alignment spread-approximately half are good and half are evil. Good cloud giants build roads from their settlements to connect with other humanoid roads in order to foster trade. It's not uncommon to see a good cloud giant walking among humans, for example, in a human city near a tall mountain range. Evil cloud giants tend not to bother with permanent settlements and instead live on high peaks in crude shelters, only coming down to raid villages for whatever they might need. These two philosophies often see violent and long-lasting wars erupt between neighboring tribes. Legends abound of magical cloud giant cities nestled in the very clouds themselves that float with the winds and circumnavigate the world. While most cloud giants recognize this as a fantasy, there are some who not only claim to have seen them but have dedicated the entirety of their long lives to finding them again.\"},\n",

Fire giants have bright orange hair that flickers and glows almost as if it were af lame. An adult male is 12 to 16 feet tall, has a chest that measures 9 feet around, and weighs about 7,000 pounds.

In large groups, fire giants fight with brutal and efficient group tactics, and aren't afraid to sacrifice one or two of their members to draw an enemy into an ambush. Fire giants prefer hot locations-the hotter, the better. They've been found in deserts, volcanoes, hot springs, and deep beneath the earth near lava vents.

Frost giant warriors also don chain shirts and metal helmets decorated with horns or feathers. An adult male stands about 15 feet tall and weighs approximately 2,800 pounds. Females are slightly shorter and lighter, but otherwise identical to males. Frost giants can live to be 250 years old. Frost giants are among the most feared giants, as their wanton destruction, battle lust, and fearless demeanor push them to ever-increasing displays of brutality. Frost giants usually start combat at a distance, throwing rocks until they run out of ammunition or the opponent closes, then wading in with their enormous greataxes. A favorite tactic is to lay an ambush by hiding buried in the snow at the top of an icy or snowy slope, where opponents will have difficulty reaching them, and then starting an avalanche before leaping into battle. Frost giants can hide well in snowy environments and are masters of stealth in their domain. Frost giants survive on hunting and raiding alone, as they live in desolate, frigid environments. Frost giant groups are split almost evenly between those that live in makeshift settlements or abandoned castles and those that roam the frozen north as nomads in search of spoils and provisions. Frost giant leaders call themselves jarls and demand absolute obedience from their followers. At any time a jarl may be challenged by combat for leadership of the tribe. These challenges typically result in the death of one of the combatants. A single jarl can often count a dozen or more smaller frost giant tribes as part of his extended tribe. In such a situation, the leaders of the lesser tribes are known simply as chieftains or warlords. Frost giants love to take captives, and use them for food as well as slaves and commodities. Every group of frost giants typically has 1-2 humanoid slaves shackled to a slave handler-usually the meanest and cruelest non-jarl in the group. They are also quite fond of monstrous pets-white dragons and winter wolves are popular choices, but remorhazes, yetis, and even linnorms can be found dwelling in a frost giant lair.\"},\n",

       "   'description': 'Skin color among hill giants ranges from light tan to deep, ruddy brown. Their hair is brown or black, with eyes the same color. Hill giants wear layers of crudely prepared hides with the fur left on. They seldom wash or repair their garments, preferring simply to add more hides as their old ones wear out. Adults are around 10 feet tall and weigh about 1,100 pounds. Hill giants can live to be 200 years old, but almost never do. Hill giants prefer to fight from high, rocky outcroppings, where they can pelt opponents with rocks and boulders while limiting the risk to themselves. Hill giants love to make overrun attacks against smaller creatures when they first join battle. Thereafter, they stand fast and swing away with their massive clubs. Hill giants are the most nomadic of all the humanoid giant species, preferring to travel from one settlement to the next in order to raid and pillage. While they prefer temperate climates, they\\'ll travel far from their preferred environment so long as the raiding is plentiful and successful. They are, as a whole, incredibly selfish creatures and rarely engage in battles they don\\'t automatically know they\\'ll win. Hill giants are known for shoving one another at terrifying foes and won\\'t hesitate to sacrifice a clanmate to save their own skins. Roving bands of hill giants are common in temperate hills, and their constant aggression makes them one of the more feared dangers in this climate. Solitary, non-evil hill giants are very rare but can sometimes be found in other humanoid societies, though they are almost never accepted in central cities or population centers. They do best as laborers and soldiers in outlying frontier towns, and often serve as rudimentary diplomats to negotiate with marauding hill giant bands. Unfortunately, hill giants who shed their racial lifestyle for civilization are mocked and often killed on sight by their nomadic brethren. Still, these \"civilized\" hill giants can find their place within society and many have managed to live peaceful, uneventful lives.'},\n",

Adults are about 12 feet tall, weigh about 1,500 pounds, and can live to be 800 years old. Stone giants fight from a distance whenever possible, but if they can't avoid melee, they favor gigantic clubs chiseled out of stone. A favorite tactic of stone giants is to stand nearly motionless, blending in with the background, then move forward to throw rocks and surprise their foes. Stone giants prefer living in enormous caves in highaltitude, rocky peaks. They rarely live more than a few days' travel from other bands of stone giants, and even raise shared herds of goats and other livestock between tribes. Older stone giants tend to wander away from the tribe for a signif icant period of time in their later years, either living in seclusion somewhere or attempting to merge into other humanoid civilizations. After decades of this self-imposed exile, those who return do so as stone giant elders. Stone Giant Elders Some stone giants develop special abilities related to their environment. Called elders, these stone giants have Charisma scores of at least 15 and three spell-like abilities (CL 10th). Once per day they can use stone shape, stone tell, and either transmute rock to mud or transmute mud to rock (DC 17). The save DC is Charisma-based. One in 10 elders is a sorcerer, usually of 3rd to 6th level. Stone giant elders add +1 to their CR.\"},\n",

Such violet coloration is considered to be good luck among storm giants, and those possessing it tend to become leaders among their kind. Adults are typically 21 feet tall and weigh 12,000 pounds. Storm giants can live to be 600 years old. When at rest, they prefer to wear short, loose tunics belted at the waist, sandals or bare feet, and headbands. They wear a few pieces of simple but finely crafted jewelry, with anklets (favored by barefoot giants), rings, or circlets being most common. Yet when they outfit themselves for battle, they don shimmering breastplates and wield enormous greatswords and bows. Storm giants tend to be reclusive, prefering to dwell along remote coastlines or on tropical islands. Yet like their namesakes, they are prone to violent mood swings. Storm giants are quick to anger in the face of evil and can be brutal, dangerous foes when insulted. In battle, they prefer to send a hail of arrows to rain down on their foes, only drawing their greatswords after opponents get inside their bow range. Storm giants live in well-constructed towers, castles, or walled settlements, and prefer to live off the land. They maintain enormous, well-tended gardens and manage hundreds of acres of farmland per group. They often hire other humanoids, such as elves or humans, to help them run their massive farms. A storm giant enclave often takes responsibility for the safety of an entire island or stretch of coastline.'},\n",

       "   'description': 'Girallons are among the jungle\\'s most dangerous predators. They are aggressive, carnivorous, highly territorial, and incredibly strong. Worse, their four muscular arms are capable of inf licting incredible damage on anything that falls into their clutches. Their exotic appearance makes them popular creatures in certain cities as attractions in gladiatorial combats, either starved and pitted against each other, or set against gladiators eager to increase their fame and notoriety. One who kills a girallon is all but assured of fame, yet most battles against these ferocious beasts end poorly for those foolish enough to attempt to single-handedly defeat one. An adult girallon is 8 feet tall, broad-chested, and covered in thick, pure white fur. It weighs roughly 800 pounds. Girallons live in troops led by a dominant male. Solitary girallons are usually young males looking to start their own troop. Girallons are very territorial and tend to attack intruders without warning, including strangers of their own kind. Groups of girallons may attack in a line to drive prey toward a cliff or other hazard, or quietly form a ring around their target and suddenly close in. While most girallons are little more than beasts, ancient carvings and the oral traditions of some tribes hint that the girallon wasn\\'t always the stupid creature it is today. According to these legends, the first girallons were men who called upon savage demon gods to gain great strength, yet in so doing abandoned their humanity. With each generation, these first girallons grew more and more savage and feral, and the same legends maintain that these intelligent girallons still dwell in the darkest part of the jungle. In addition to their intellects, these girallons retain a vast appetite for cruelty. Called \"high girallons,\" these creatures are almost always chaotic evil, and have Intelligence scores of 6 or higher. An intelligent girallon generally speaks whatever language the local humans speak. Often, they become leaders of unusually large troops of their less-intelligent kin, inhabit strange ruined cities in the jungle or mountains, and conduct raids on villages for food and treasure. Some primitive tribes worship these girallons as the agents of evil gods or demons, and a few high girallons have been known to work for or even breed with tribal orcs, inspiring legends of four-armed \"white orcs.\"'},\n",

Even a dead or fallen comrade is a fresh meal for a gnoll, who might honor a distinguished tribe member with a brief prayer, or thoroughly cook one that has died of a wasting disease, but otherwise view a dead gnoll as little different from any other creature. The more \"civilized\" gnolls do not eat their prisoners, but instead keep them as slaves, either to defend or improve their lair or to trade with other tribes or slaver bands. Gnolls relish combat, but only when they have the obvious advantage of numbers. In other situations, they prefer to avoid combat except as a means of winning a kill from another hunter, or as a clever ambush to bring down a large meal. These hyena-men see no value in courage or valor, instead preferring to flee once it becomes clear that victory is not possible, noting that it is better to run with tail tucked away than to lose one\\'s tail entirely. During combat, gnolls use a strange mixture of pack tactics and individual standoffs. If a gnoll feels that it is winning, it attempts to take down a weaker being rather than aiding its fellows. If the gnolls are struggling, they gang up on a powerful leader and try to take that creature down, in the hopes of forcing its allies to flee. Gnoll leaders are typically rangers, although clerics are highly regarded as well. Most gnolls find arcane magic difficult to master, and as a result it is relatively rare to see a gnoll bard, sorcerer, or wizard.'},\n",

       "   'description': \"Goblins prefer to dwell in caves, amid large and dense thickets of thistles and brambles, or in structures built and then abandoned by others. Very few goblins have the drive to build structures of their own. Coastlines are favored, as goblins are quite fond of sifting through junk and flotsam in an unending quest to find treasures among the refuse of more civilized races. Goblin hatred runs deep, and few things inspire their wrath more than gnomes (who have long fought against goblins), horses (who frighten goblins tremendously), and regular dogs (whom goblins regard as pale imitations of goblin dogs). Goblins are also quite superstitious, and treat magic with a fawning mixture of awe and fear. They have the habit of ascribing magic to the mundane as well, with fire and writing both taking on mystical power in goblin society. Fire is much loved by goblins for its capacity to wreak great destruction and because it doesn't require size or strength to wield, but written words are hated. Goblins believe that writing steals words out of your head, and as a result of this belief, goblins are universally illiterate. Goblins are voracious and can eat their body weight in food daily without growing fat. Goblin lairs always have numerous storerooms and larders. While they prefer human and gnome flesh, a goblin won't turn down any food-except, perhaps, vegetables. Goblin Characters Goblins are defined by their class levels-they do not possess racial Hit Dice. All goblins have the following racial traits. -2 Strength, +4 Dexterity, -2 Charisma: Goblins are fast, but weak and unpleasant to be around. Small: Goblins are Small creatures and gain a +1 size bonus to their AC, a +1 size bonus on attack rolls, a -1 penalty to their CMB and CMD, and a +4 size bonus on Stealth checks. Fast: Goblins are fast for their size, and have a base speed of 30 feet. Darkvision: Goblins can see in the dark up to 60 feet. Skilled: +4 racial bonus on Ride and Stealth checks. Languages: Goblins begin play speaking Goblin. Goblins with high Intelligence scores can choose any of these bonus languages: Common, Draconic, Dwarven, Gnoll, Gnome, Halfling, Orc.\"},\n",

It\\'s no surprise that goblins find kindred spirits in these shunned, disgusting beasts. Constantly itching, aff licted with a species-wide mange exacerbated by prolific dander, even the healthiest goblin dog looks sickly and starved. Despite its name, the goblin dog is in fact a species of rodent grown monstrously large. Their long-legged shape and proclivity to hunt and run in packs earned them their popular name, a name that many goblins take issue with, as it galls the average goblin to consider these, their favored mounts, having anything at all to do with actual dogs. Of course, being goblins, they haven\\'t bothered to come up with alternate names for goblin dogs. Perhaps they don\\'t realize they can. Contact with a goblin dog\\'s infested, mangy hide causes most other creatures to break out into hives, a condition known as \"goblin rash.\" Goblinoids seem to be immune to this affliction, and are fond of keeping goblin dogs as guardians and mounts. Despite their skin conditions and disorders, goblin dogs are highly resistant to disease. Their favored food is carrion-the riper, the better. That many goblin tribes let their goblin dogs run free in their lairs is the single reason most goblin dens aren\\'t filthier than they actually are; constantly hungry, a goblin dog eats anything it can chew that it finds left behind by other, more discerning palates.

A flesh golem stands 8 feet tall and weighs 500 pounds. A flesh golem cannot speak, although it can emit a hoarse roar of sorts.

The head (and thus brain) of such flesh golems must be just the right combination of fresh and (in its previous life) strong-willed, and even then luck and chance during the golem's creation seem just as important in retaining the creature's mind. Certainly most who construct flesh golems prefer mindless slaves over free-willed creations, and as a result intelligent flesh golems are rare indeed.

For example, it might look like it is wearing armor, with a particular symbol carved on the breastplate, or have designs worked into the stone of its limbs. Its head is often carved to resemble a helmet or the head of some beast. While it may be sculpted to carry a stone shield or stone weapon such as a sword, these aesthetic choices do not affect its combat abilities.

Like aggressive bulls, they challenge any unfamiliar creature they encounter, often trampling their opponent's corpse or shattering its stony remnants until the creature is unrecognizable. The females are just as dangerous as the males, and the two sexes appear identical. A typical gorgon stands 6 feet tall and 8 feet long. It weighs 4,000 pounds. Gorgons derive nutrients from the consumption of minerals, particularly the stone of their petrified victims, and any statues they create are likely to be gnawed thoroughly. They cannot digest metal or gems, so their dung (which resembles bitter-smelling gray powder) often contains small, raw crystals and nuggets of ore. Their aggression toward all other creatures means that there are few to no predators or other prey animals in their grazing grounds. Each herd is led by a dominant bull; solitary gorgons are usually adolescent bulls driven out of their herd by the lead bull. Their flesh is tough but beefy (once the armored hide is removed), and to those who acquire the taste, quite filling. Many stone giant tribes believe eating gorgon meat enhances their own natural armor. Powdered gorgon horn is worth 250 gp as an alternate material component for magic items using bull's strength, stoneskin, flesh to stone, statue, and similar magic.\"},\n",

       "   'description': \"Slinking their way through cold swamps and bleary marshlands, or sometimes even dungeons and caverns, gray oozes consume any organic materials they encounter. Despite its lack of intelligence, the gray ooze is a most problematic creature due to its transparency. While the ooze cannot easily climb walls or swim, its habit of lurking in the thick mud that lines the banks of marsh pools or lying in harmless-looking pools on dull-colored dungeon floors makes it dangerously easy to overlook and step on. Some sages believe that the gray ooze is the result of a failed alchemical experiment, while others postulate that the first gray oozes spontaneously arose from a cesspit of magical detritus. Of course, these theories that gray oozes are not living organisms, but rather the alchemical result of an unfortunate mixture of rare caustic fluids and magical waste, are derided by many who dwell in areas plagued by the creatures but which do not have a long history of magical pollution. Variant Gray Oozes The gray ooze adapts readily and swiftly to changes in environments, the simple structure of its primeval form and its method of using fission to reproduce all but ensuring that such changes occur. Listed below are two such variants that adventurers have encountered. Crystal Ooze (CR 4): The crystal ooze is an aquatic variant that dwells in deeper waters than most commonly found in the gray ooze's beloved swamps. A crystal ooze has the aquatic subtype and a swim speed of 30 ft. The crystal ooze lacks the gray ooze's constrict ability, but it does secrete a paralytic toxin that causes those whom it strikes to become paralyzed for 3d6 rounds if they fail a Fortitude saving throw (the save DC is Constitution-based). Id Ooze (CR 6): Perhaps the strangest variant gray oozes are those that have developed a rudimentary intelligence, including the ability to communicate telepathically with other oozes, or even the ability to blast enemies with pulses of raw mental power. Id oozes are advanced gray oozes with an Intelligence score of 2 (and thus gain skill ranks and feats-typically 4 ranks in Stealth, Improved Initiative, and Toughness), can communicate basic empathic information with other id oozes within 100 feet via telepathy, and can use lesser confusion at will as a spell-like ability (CL equals the id ooze's HD).\"},\n",

They are particularly fond of using disguise self to assume the forms of alluring young maidens and then seducing young men away from their lovers or families. In this form, they can infect such noble and upstanding citizens with all manner of debauchery and scandal. Some green hags prefer to reveal their true natures to their lovers at a moment precisely engineered to drive the man mad with horror and shame. Others drag out their dalliances and do what they can to utterly ruin the lives of the men they seduce before showing the broken shell that remains the truth.

A typical green hag stands between 5 and 6 feet tall and weighs just under 160 pounds. Hag Covens When three hags of any type gather, they can form a coven to gain increased magical ability. Any combination of hags can form a coven, but green hags are the most common members of such foul gatherings.

All three hags must take a fullround action to take part in this form of cooperative magic. All coven spell-like abilities function at CL 9th (or at the highest CL available to the most powerful hag in the coven). The save DCs are Charisma-based, and function as if with a Charisma score of 16 unless one of the hags has a higher Charisma score, in which case the spell-like ability DCs are adjusted by that hag's Charisma modif ier.

Aggressive and territorial, they are no mere beasts, but rather calculating combatants and loyal companions to those who earn their respect, fighting to the death to protect their friends and kin. Weighing in at over 500 pounds and measuring 8 feet long from hooked beak to tufted tail, the griffon strikes an imposing silhouette that has long been used in heraldry and other iconography as a symbol of power, authority, and justice. In reality, the griffon is less concerned with abstract concepts than with hunting food and protecting its own. While they can sometimes be trained or befriended to serve as mounts, griffons have no inherent affinity for humanoids, and frequently come into bloody conf lict with civilized races over their attempts to secure their favorite food-horse flesh. City folk may marvel at the trained griffon's stately manner and 25-foot wingspan, but those farmers forced to share territory with its wild kin know to hurry home and secure their barns when the beasts' hunting shrieks split the sky. Griffons mate for life, and will often search for years to take vengeance over a slain mate or child. It was likely this innate stubbornness and fierce loyalty that first brought them into domestic use as mounts and guardians of treasure hoards. Despite the inherent danger, trade in captured griffons and stolen eggs is brisk, with their eggs worth up to 3,500 gp apiece and live young twice that. Characters eager for griffon mounts, however, should note that buying or forcibly domesticating intelligent creatures like griffons is still recognized as slavery by most good deities, and winning a griffon's allegiance of its own free will is no easy task. Reaching a mutually agreeable accord (or even a friendship) is a much more elegant and safe route to securing a griffon mount. Before it can be ridden in combat, a griffon requires practice bearing the weight of its rider. In order to be trained successfully, a griffon must first be helpful toward its trainer (possibly requiring a Diplomacy, Intimidate, or Handle Animal check). After that, 6 weeks of practice and a successful DC 20 Handle Animal check is sufficient for the beast to be comfortable with its burden, and due to their intelligence, trained griffons can be treated as knowing every trick listed in the Handle Animal skill description, possibly even responding to new, simple requests made in Common. Griffons can carry up to 300 pounds as a light load, 600 pounds as a medium load, and 900 pounds as a heavy load. Riding a griffon requires an exotic saddle.\"},\n",

A half-dragon retains all the base creature\\'s statistics and special abilities except as noted here. CR: Same as the base creature +2 (minimum 3). Type: Creature type changes to dragon. Do not recalculate HD, BAB, or saves. Armor Class: Nat. armor improves by +4. Special Qualities and Defenses: A half-dragon gains darkvision 60 feet; low-light vision; and immunity to sleep, paralysis, and energy of the same type as its breath weapon. Speed: A half-dragon has wings. Unless the base creature has a better fly speed, the half-dragon can fly at twice the creature\\'s base land speed (average maneuverability). Melee: A half-dragon has two claw attacks and a bite attack. If the base creature can use manufactured weapons, the half-dragon can as well. A new claw or bite attack deals damage as appropriate for the half-dragon\\'s size (see \"Natural Attacks\" on pages 301-302). Special Abilities: A half-dragon retains all the special attacks of the base creature and gains a breath weapon usable once per day based on the dragon variety (see below). The breath weapon deals 1d6 hit points of damage per racial HD possessed by the half-dragon (Ref lex half; DC 10 +1/2 creature\\'s racial HD +creature\\'s Con modifier).

While ultimately savage and without remorse for their actions, a number of harpies live close to humanoid societies and enjoy parlaying with creatures that they see as potential meals. Harpies tend to wear baubles and trinkets stolen from their victims, as they like to indulge in the shiny ornaments of mankind. Up close, these creatures reek with the stench of consumed victims, and they rarely let creatures not yet captivated too near, lest they smell the gore and decay upon their feathers. For this reason, many harpies wear perfumes and scented oils. Harpies appear wildly different in different lands. Some seem like an amalgam of vultures and women, while others bear the regal markings of hawks or falcons in their feathers.

       "   'description': 'Hobgoblins are militaristic and fecund, a combination that makes them quite dangerous in some regions. They breed quickly, replacing fallen members with new soldiers and keeping up their numbers despite the fortunes of war. They generally need little reason to declare war, but more often than not that reason is to capture new slaves-life as a slave in a hobgoblin lair is brutal and short, and new slaves are always needed to replace those who fall or are eaten. Of all the goblinoid races, the hobgoblin is by far the most civilized. They see the larger and more solitary bugbears as tools to be hired and used where appropriate, usually for specif ic missions involving assassination and stealth, and look upon their smaller goblin kin with a mix of shame and frustration. Hobgoblins admire goblin tenacity, yet their miniscule kindred\\'s unpredictable nature and fondness for fire make them unwelcome additions to hobgoblin tribes or settlements. Nonetheless, most hobgoblin tribes include a small group of goblins, typically squatting in the most undesirable corners of the settlement. Many hobgoblin tribes combine their love of warfare with keen intellects. The science of siege engines, alchemy, and complex feats of engineering fascinate most hobgoblins, and those who are particularly skilled are treated as heroes and invariably secure high-ranking positions in the tribe. Slaves with analytical minds are quite valued, and as such raids on dwarven cities are commonplace. It is well known that hobgoblins mistrust and even despise magic, particularly arcane magic. Their shamans are treated with a mix of fear and respect, and are usually forced to live alone on the fringes of the tribe\\'s lair. It is all but unheard of to find a hobgoblin practicing arcane magic, or as hobgoblins call it, \"elf magic.\" This is the root of their hatred of magic-the hobgoblins\\' hatred of elves. A hobgoblin stands 5 feet tall and weighs 160 pounds. Hobgoblin Characters Hobgoblins are defined by their class levels-they do not possess racial Hit Dice. All hobgoblins have the following racial traits. +2 Dexterity, +2 Constitution: Hobgoblins are fast and hearty. Darkvision: Hobgoblins can see in the dark up to 60 feet. Sneaky: Hobgoblins gain a +4 racial bonus on Stealth checks. Languages: All hobgoblins begin play speaking Common and Goblin. Hobgoblins with high Intelligence scores can choose any of the following bonus languages: Draconic, Dwarven, Infernal, Giant, Orc.'},\n",

       "   'description': \"A homunculus is a miniature servant created by a spellcaster from his own blood. They are weak combatants but make effective spies, messengers, and scouts. A homunculus's creator determines its precise features; some are more refined looking, but most creators don't bother to improve the creature's appearance beyond the minimum necessary for functioning. Homunculi are little more than tools designed to carry out assigned tasks. They are extensions of their creators, sharing the same alignment and basic nature. A homunculus never willingly travels more than a mile from its master, though it can be removed forcibly. If this occurs, the creature does everything in its power to return to this range, as it cannot communicate with its master beyond this distance. An attack that destroys a homunculus deals 2d10 points of damage to its master. If the creature's master is slain, the homunculus goes insane-it loses its Intelligence score, all feats, and all skill ranks, and generally claims the immediate surroundings as its domain, mindlessly attacking any who intrude upon its lair. On rare occasions, a homunculus freed from its servitude rises above its master's original intent and becomes more than a half-insane construct guardian of a long-forgotten lair. In some cases, a homunculus might even come to see itself as the rightful heir to its master's legacy, or even the reincarnated spirit of the master himself. Construction A homunculus is shaped from a mixture of clay, ash, mandrake root, spring water, and one pint of the creator's own blood. These materials cost 50 gp. After the body is sculpted, it is animated through an extended magical ritual that requires a specially prepared laboratory or workroom, similar to an alchemist's laboratory, and costing an additional 1,000 gp to supply. If the creator is personally constructing the creature's body, the building and ritual can be performed together. A homunculus with more than 2 Hit Dice can be created, but each additional Hit Die adds +2,000 gp to the cost to create. The person whose blood is used to form a homunculus's body becomes its master; it is possible for one person to give blood for the creation, another to sculpt the base material, and another to magically animate it as a minion for the one who provided the blood. Homunculus CL 7th; Price 2,050 gp Construction Requirements Craft Construct, arcane eye, mirror image, mending; Skill Craft (leather) or Craft (sculptures) DC 12; Cost 1,050 gp.\"},\n",

Brought to this world from the Plane of Air, these creatures fulfill tasks for those who conjure them. Invisible stalkers act as guardians, assassins, and trackers, occupations in which they excel. Their natural invisibility and skill at stealth allow them to follow their quarry without detection and give them the upper hand when it comes to exterminating a mark. Many invisible stalkers resent this and see these petty tasks as nothing more than chores dictated by mortals. When given a particularly complex or bothersome task, an invisible stalker seeks to find a loophole in a poorly worded instruction. For instance, wizards calling an invisible stalker into service with the instructions \"protect me from danger\" might find themselves escorted to a faraway hidden location, or even brought to the Plane of Air. Due to their constant summoning, many invisible stalkers harbor hostility for those dwelling on the Material Plane. Those invisible stalkers new to the mortal world only know the stories of their kind and tend to keep an open mind about the intentions of those who call them. Over time, or in the service of a particularly vile master, invisible stalkers form negative opinions of these creatures of flesh and bone, leading to their tendency to pervert their instructions and cause harm to their masters. For older and more experienced invisible stalkers, the only thing protecting those who summon them is the magic that binds them. These creatures automatically try to use inconsistencies in the wording of their tasks and literal twists on the intention to find a way to inconvenience, injure, or even kill the priest or arcanist that brought them to the plane.'},\n",

The iron cobra is typically used as a bodyguard or guardian of treasure, though its magical ability to unerringly locate creatures means it is also used as an assassin. Since an iron cobra's poison reservoir can contain multiple types of venom, the construct's specific use can be further tailored by varying the poison used. Some spellcasters even fill these reservoirs with potions, so that when the cobra bites, it injects the potion into its target. This is a somewhat dangerous method for gaining the effects of a potion, but it does free up the cobra's master to do other things in a combat round apart from quaffing potions. Iron is the most common material for these creations, but some crafters prefer more exotic materials when creating the serpentine constructs. Adamantine Cobra (+1 CR): This cobra is more solidly built than others. Its natural armor bonus increases to +12, it gains +5 hp per HD, and it gains DR 10/-. Cold Iron Cobra (+0 CR): This cobra's natural attacks count as cold iron for the purpose of bypassing DR. Darkwood Cobra (+0 CR): This cobra is more mobile; it gains a swim speed of 30 ft. and a climb speed of 20 ft. Mithral Cobra (+1 CR): This cobra is much swifter.

Due to their physical similarities, kobolds loudly proclaim themselves the scions of dragonkind, destined to rule the earth beneath the wings of their great god-cousins, but most dragons have little use for the obnoxious pests. While they may speak loudly of divine right and manifest destiny, kobolds are keenly aware of their own weakness. Cowards and schemers, they never fight fair if they can help it, instead setting up ambushes and doublecrosses, holing up in their warrens behind countless crude but ingenious traps, or rolling over the enemy in vast, yipping hordes. Kobold coloration varies even among siblings from the same egg clutch, ranging through the colors of the chromatic dragons, with red being the most common but white, green, blue, and black kobolds not unheard of. Kobold Characters Kobolds are defined by their class levels-they do not possess racial Hit Dice. A kobold with NPC class levels takes a -3 penalty to its CR (rather than the normal -2 penalty). All kobolds have the following racial traits. -4 Strength, +2 Dexterity, -2 Constitution: Kobolds are fast but weak. Small: Kobolds are Small and gain a +1 size bonus to their AC, a +1 size bonus on attack rolls, a -1 penalty to their CMB and CMD, and a +4 size bonus on Stealth checks. Normal Speed: Kobolds have a base speed of 30 feet. Darkvision: Kobolds can see in the dark up to 60 feet. Armor: Kobolds have a +1 natural armor bonus. Crafty: Kobolds gain a +2 racial bonus on Craft (trapmaking), Perception, and Profession (miner) checks. Craft (trapmaking) and Stealth are always class skills for a kobold. Weakness: Light sensitivity (see page 301). Languages: Kobolds begin play speaking only Draconic. Kobolds who have high Intelligence scores can choose any of the following bonus languages: Common, Dwarven, Gnome, and Undercommon.'},\n",

Many suggest that kytons were natives of Hell who existed there before the advent of devilkind, while others hypothesize they were later brought to the plane by some sadistic power. Regardless of their origins, kytons roam the planes in their lust to cause and receive suffering, seeking pain through violent abductions and sadistic debauches. The kyton presented here is a typical member of this fiendish race of outsiders, but is by no means the only type of its kind. Just as there are numerous different species of demon and devil, rumor holds that different kinds of kytons dwell in their jangling cities in Hell and on the Plane of Shadow. These kytons are invariably more powerful than the one presented here, often having spell-like abilities or hideous and unsettling special attacks along the themes of torture and pain. Rumor holds that the most powerful kytons are completely inhuman, and that these monsters are the true progenators of the kyton race-the kyton presented here but the result of unholy dalliances with their unfortunate victims.'},\n",

Crumbling keeps, abandoned cities, and forgotten monuments all satisfy these deadly hunters' cruel aesthetic-particularly those in arid or otherwise lifeless environs. Foremost, though, lamias favor decrepit temples. They delight in seeing the shrines of good deities in ruins and go out of their way to bring hardship to thriving holy places. Lamias look to the eldest female of the group as their leader, mother, and shaman, cleaving to her with fanatical reverence. While lamias shun most religious followings-viewing such as the source of the curse that blighted them with bestial forms-lamia elders claim to hear the whispers of the scouring desert winds and know the cold whims of the stars, drawing upon such mystical sources to lead their people. The lamias presented here are but the most common and least powerful members of this cursed race, with others bearing serpentine, avian, and even more perverse forms.\"},\n",

       "   'description': 'Few creatures are more feared than the lich. The pinnacle of necromantic art, the lich is a spellcaster who has chosen to shed his life as a method to cheat death by becoming undead. While many who reach such heights of power stop at nothing to achieve immortality, the idea of becoming a lich is abhorrent to most creatures. The process involves the extraction of the spellcaster\\'s life-force and its imprisonment in a specially prepared phylactery-the spellcaster gives up life, but in trapping life he also traps his death, and as long as his phylactery remains intact he can continue on in his research and work without fear of the passage of time. The quest to become a lich is a lengthy one. While construction of the magical phylactery to contain the spellcaster\\'s soul is a critical component, a prospective lich must also learn the secrets of transferring his soul into the receptacle and of preparing his body for the transformation into undeath, neither of which are simple tasks. Further complicating the ritual is the fact that no two bodies or souls are exactly alike-a ritual that works for one spellcaster might simply kill another or drive him insane. The exact methods for each spellcaster\\'s transformation are left to the GM\\'s discretion, but should involve expenditures of hundreds of thousands of gold pieces, numerous deadly adventures, and a large number of difficult skill checks over the course of months, years, or decades. The Lich\\'s Phylactery An integral part of becoming a lich is the creation of the phylactery in which the character stores his soul. The only way to get rid of a lich for sure is to destroy its phylactery. Unless its phylactery is located and destroyed, a lich can rejuvenate after it is killed (see Creating a Lich, below). Each lich must create its own phylactery by using the Craft Wondrous Item feat. The character must be able to cast spells and have a caster level of 11th or higher. The phylactery costs 120,000 gp to create and has a caster level equal to that of its creator at the time of creation. The most common form of phylactery is a sealed metal box containing strips of parchment on which magical phrases have been transcribed. The box is Tiny and has 40 hit points, hardness 20, and a break DC of 40. Other forms of phylacteries can exist, such as rings, amulets, or similar items. Creating a Lich \"Lich\" is an acquired template that can be added to any living creature (referred to hereafter as the base creature), provided it can create the required phylactery. A lich retains all the base creature\\'s statistics and special abilities except as noted here. CR: Same as the base creature +2. Alignment: Any evil. Type: The creature\\'s type changes to undead. Do not recalculate BAB, saves, or skill ranks. Senses: A lich gains darkvision 60 ft. Armor Class: A lich has a +5 natural armor bonus or the base creature\\'s natural armor bonus, whichever is better. Hit Dice: Change all of the creature\\'s racial Hit Dice to d8s. All Hit Dice derived from class levels remain unchanged. As undead, liches use their Charisma modifiers to determine bonus hit points (instead of Constitution). Defensive Abilities: A lich gains channel resistance +4, DR 15/bludgeoning and magic, and immunity to cold and electricity (in addition to those granted by its undead traits). The lich also gains the following defensive ability. Rejuvenation (Su): When a lich is destroyed, its phylactery (which is generally hidden by the lich in a safe place far from where it chooses to dwell) immediately begins to rebuild the undead spellcaster\\'s body nearby. This process takes 1d10 days-if the body is destroyed before that time passes, the phylactery merely starts the process anew. After this time passes, the lich wakens fully healed (albeit without any gear it left behind on its old body), usually with a burning need for revenge against those who previously destroyed it. Melee Attack: A lich has a touch attack that it can use once per round as a natural weapon. A lich fighting without weapons uses its natural weapons (if it has any) in addition to its touch attack (which is treated as a primary natural weapon that replaces one claw or slam attack, if the creature has any). A lich armed with a weapon uses its weapons normally, and can use its touch attack as a secondary natural weapon. Damage: A lich\\'s touch attack uses negative energy to deal 1d8 points of damage to living creatures +1 point of damage per 2 Hit Dice possessed by the lich. As negative energy, this damage can be used to heal undead creatures. A lich can take a full-round action to infuse itself with this energy, healing damage as if it had used its touch attack against itself. Special Attacks: A lich gains the two special attacks described below. Save DCs are equal to 10 +1/2 lich\\'s HD +lich\\'s Cha modifier unless otherwise noted. Fear Aura (Su): Creatures of less than 5 HD in a 60-foot radius that look at the lich must succeed on a Will save or become frightened. Creatures with 5 HD or more must succeed at a Will save or be shaken for a number of rounds equal to the lich\\'s Hit Dice. A creature that successfully saves cannot be affected again by the same lich\\'s aura for 24 hours. This is a mind-affecting fear effect. Paralyzing Touch (Su): Any living creature a lich hits with its touch attack must succeed on a Fortitude save or be permanently paralyzed. Remove paralysis or any spell that can remove a curse can free the victim (see the bestow curse spell description, with a DC equal to the lich\\'s save DC). The effect cannot be dispelled. Anyone paralyzed by a lich seems dead, though a DC 20 Perception check or a DC 15 Heal check reveals that the victim is still alive. Abilities: Int +2, Wis +2, Cha +2. Being undead, a lich has no Constitution score. Skills: Liches have a +8 racial bonus on Perception, Sense Motive, and Stealth checks. A lich always treats Climb, Disguise, Fly, Intimidate, Knowledge (arcana), Knowledge (religion), Perception, Sense Motive, Spellcraft, and Stealth as class skills. Otherwise, skills are the same as the base creature.'},\n",

       "   'description': 'Lizardfolk are proud and powerful reptilian predators that make their communal homes in scattered villages deep within swamps and marshes. Uninterested in colonization of the dry lands and content with the simple weapons and rituals that have served them well for millennia, lizardfolk are viewed by many other races as backwater savages, but within their isolated communities lizardfolk are actually a vibrant people filled with tradition and an oral history stretching back to before humans walked upright. Most lizardfolk stand 6 to 7 feet tall and weigh 200 to 250 pounds, their powerful muscles covered in scales of gray, green, or brown. Some breeds have short dorsal spikes or brightly colored frills, and all swim well by moving with flicks of their powerful 4-foot-long tails. While completely at home in the water, they breathe air and return to their clustered mound-dwellings to breed and sleep. As their reptilian blood makes them sluggish in the cold, most lizardfolk hunt and work during the day and retreat to their homes at night to curl up with other tribesmen in the shared warmth of large peat fires. Though generally neutral, lizardfolks\\' standoffish demeanor, staunch rejection of civilization\\'s \"gifts,\" and legendary ferocity in battle cause them to be viewed negatively by most humanoids. These traits stem from good reasons, however, as their own slow rate of reproduction is no match for warm-blooded humanoids, and those tribes who don\\'t defend their wetland territories to the last breath quickly find themselves overwhelmed by the mammalian hordes. As for their tendency to consume the bodies of dead friends and enemies alike, the practical lizardfolk are quick to point out that life is hard in the swamp, and nothing should go to waste. The lizardfolk presented here dwell in a swampy environment. Lizardfolk tribes can exist in other environments as well, but they lose their swim speed and instead gain a climb speed of 15 feet.'},\n",

They like lairs in high places, such as hilltops and caves in cliffs. Although manticores were likely a magical creation, they have long since established themselves as a naturally occurring species. Curiously, manticores seem strangely fecund, and can interbreed with a number of other similarly shaped creatures, including lions, dire lions, lamias, sphinxes, and even chimeras.

The giant mantis, a master of hiding in dense undergrowth, is almost unnaturally patient as it lies in wait, striking with unsettling speed as unsuspecting meals wander by. In many savage societies, the giant mantis is particularly feared-in regions where these vermin are common, they are often regarded as messengers of death sent to the world by angry gods. Their swift speed, alien appearance, and near-invisibility in forests give rise to many legends-that the giant mantis can become invisible, that it can smell fear, and that the souls of those who it slays and eats are digested and kept from moving on to the afterlife. While the giant mantis is nothing more than an efficient and deadly vermin, the numerous legends and whispers regarding its supposed powers and alien intellect have inspired some spellcasters to work such features into their constructs as a way to make them even more fearsome. There are even stories of entire societies of assassins who worship an immense mantis as a god, and who have taken to heart the mantis's style of murderous ambush, fighting with twin serrated rapiers. The giant mantis presented here stands 7 feet tall and 15 feet long, and weighs 650 pounds. Larger giant mantises exist in the deepest, darkest forests of the world, where they might prey upon things as mighty as giants or dragons. Known by various names, such as the drakeeating mantis, the treebender mantis, or simply the deadly mantis, these immense behemoths average more than 60 feet in height and have a terrifying habit of destroying entire villages or towns in order to satiate their ravenous appetites. A deadly mantis is a giant mantis advanced to Colossal size, 16 Hit Dice, and CR 14.\"},\n",

       "   'description': \"Medusas are human-like creatures with snakes instead of hair. At distances of 30 feet or more, a medusa can easily pass for a beautiful woman if she wears something to cover her serpentine locks-when wearing clothing that conceals her head and face, she can be mistaken for a human at even closer distances. Medusas use lies and disguises that conceal their faces to get close enough to opponents to use their petrifying gaze, though they like playing with their prey and may fire arrows from a distance to lead enemies into traps. Some enjoy creating intricate decorations out of their victims, using their petrified remains as accents to their swampy lairs, but most medusas take care to hide the evidence of their previous conf licts so that new foes won't have advance warning of their presence. Used to concealing themselves, medusas in cities are usually rogues, while those in the wilderness often pass themselves off as rangers or trackers. The most notorious and legendary medusas, though, are those who take levels as bards or clerics. Charismatic and intelligent, urban medusas are often involved with thieves' guilds or other aspects of the criminal underworld. Medusas may form alliances with blind creatures or intelligent undead, both of which are immune to their stony gaze. Spellcasting medusas often serve as oracles or prophets, usually dwelling in remote locations of legendary power or infamous history. Such oracle medusas take great delight in their roles, and if presented with the proper gifts and flattery, the secrets they offer can be quite helpful. Of course, the lairs of such potent creatures are liberally decorated with statues of those who have offended them, so the seeker of knowledge is well advised to tred carefully during such meetings. All known medusas are female. Rarely, a medusa may decide to keep a male humanoid as a mate, usually with the help of elixirs of love or similar magic, and is always careful to not petrify her prisoner-at least until she grows tired of his company.\"},\n",

A merfolk's lower body consists of the fins and tail of a great fish. Depending on the region, the scales of merfolk vary in hue, including gleaming silver, pale green, or even blue with stripes of yellow and crimson. Merfolk typically measure 6 to 8 feet in length and weigh over 200 pounds, with females being slightly smaller than males. Although amphibious, merfolk move only with difficulty on land and rarely wander more than a mile from sea. It is quite rare for a merfolk to make contact with a creature not of its kind. In fact, many go to great lengths to steer sailors away from their lands, even resorting to violence if necessary. Ancient accounts hint at merfolk protecting a terrible secret bound to the depths, and though no reports mention what this secret is, the lengths merfolk go to remain isolated from other races highlight the importance of this safeguard. While merfolk outwardly appear to be a beautiful and powerful race, some sages and seafarers whisper that degenerate and mutated merfolk roam the deepest, most isolated regions of the seas and oceans. Some evidence states that this offshoot fell to the worship of twisted and sinister powers lurking in the darkness below, while other theories include all merfolk in this sinister agenda, holding that even those merfolk who believe they control their own destinies are, in fact, merely unknowing puppets of a sinister and unknown master race deep under the sea. Merfolk Characters Merfolk are defined by their class levels-they do not possess racial Hit Dice. All merfolk have the following racial traits. +2 Dexterity, +2 Constitution, +2 Charisma: Merfolk are graceful, hale, and beautiful. +2 Natural Armor: Merfolk have tough skin. Aquatic: Merfolk are aquatic and can breathe water. Their land speed is 5 feet, but their swim speed is 50 feet. They are amphibious, but prefer not to spend long periods out of the water. Low-Light Vision: All merfolk have low-light vision. Languages: Merfolk begin play speaking Common and Aquan. Merfolk with high Intelligence scores can choose any of the following bonus Languages: Aboleth, Aklo, Draconic, Elven, Sahuagin, and Sylvan.\"},\n",

Though mimics are not inherently evil, some sages believe that mimics attack humans and other intelligent creatures for sport rather than merely for sustenance. The desire to completely fool others is thought to be a part of their being, and their surprise attacks against others are a culmination of those desires. A typical mimic has a volume of 150 cubic feet (5 feet by 5 feet by 6 feet) and weighs about 900 pounds.

Scorned by the civilized races centuries ago and born from a deif ic curse, minotaurs have hunted, slain, and devoured lesser humanoids in retribution for real or imagined slights for as long as anyone can remember. Many cultures have legends of how the first minotaurs were created by vengeful or slighted gods who punished humans by twisting their forms, robbing them of their intellects and beauty, and giving them the heads of bulls. Yet most modern minotaurs hold these legends in contempt and believe that they are not divine mockeries but divine paragons created by a potent and cruel demon lord named Baphomet. The traditional minotaur's lair is a maze, be it a legitimate labyrinth constructed to baff le and confuse, an accidental one such as a city sewer system, or a naturally occurring one such as a tangle of caverns and other underground passageways. Employing their innate cunning, minotaurs use their maze lairs to vex unwary foes who seek them out or who simply stumble into the lairs and become lost, slowly hunting the intruders as they try in vain to find a way out. Only when despair has truly set in does the minotaur move in to strike at its lost victims. When dealing with a group, minotaurs often let one creature escape, to spread the tale of horror and lure others to their mazes in hope of slaying the beasts. Of course, to minotaurs, these would-be heroes make for delicious meals. Minotaurs might also be found in the employ of a more powerful monster or evil creature, serving it so long as they can still hunt and dine as they please. Usually this means guarding some powerful object or valuable location, but it can also be a sort of mercenary work, hunting down the foes of its master. Minotaurs are relatively straightforward combatants, using their horns to horribly gore the nearest living creature when combat begins.\"},\n",

Hideously ugly, even goblins have been known to mock mites for their homely appearances, mockery most mites take to heart and nurture for weeks, months, or even years in their tiny homes, until their distress and anger finally overcome their natural cowardice and impel them forth on short-lived bouts of bloody vengeance from the doubtful safety of a spider's back. Mites, once closer to the strange realm of the fey, have grown larger and stockier after countless generations spent on the Material Plane. Yet still, their stature places them at the bottom of the pile in the dangerous caverns in which they live. Their traditional enemies are dwarves and gnomes, particularly the svirfneblin of the deep underground caves. The one thing that gives them a significant edge over an enemy in a fight is their natural ability to empathize with normally mindless vermin-mites are particularly fond of spiders, centipedes, and cave fishers, and a mite colony usually has a few of these far more dangerous monsters on hand to defend the group. Although they have lost the supernatural ability to tinker with magic items, luck, or mechanical objects possessed by their more sinister and dangerous gremlin kin, mites retain the ability to perform minor magical tricks with prestidigitation, and often use these tricks to annoy their enemies. When faced with dangerous foes, a mite uses its doom ability to hex a foe-a mite's eyes bulge hideously open when it uses this spell-like ability. A mite is 3 feet tall and weighs 40 pounds.\"},\n",

       "   'description': 'Those who slay many over the course of their lifetimes, be they serial killers, mass-murderers, warmongering soldiers, or battle-driven berserkers, become marked and tainted by the sheer weight of their murderous deeds. When such killers are brought to justice and publicly executed for their heinous crimes before they have a chance to atone, the remains sometimes return to unlife to continue their dark work as a mohrg. Undead things caring less for life than they did before their own deaths, mohrgs exist solely to wreak havoc on the living. Sometimes mistaken for skeletons or zombies, they are far more dangerous than those mindless abominations, retaining some semblance of their own memories-and the delight they once took in hearing the screams of the dying. When possible, mohrgs gather in small groups, seeking out lone targets much as they did in life. If faced with capable foes, a mohrg attempts to incapacitate them one by one, starting with divinely empowered characters first, both to protect itself from holy wrath, and to make the task of paralyzing and devouring the others that much easier. Some mohrgs retain enough of their former memories that they return to the favored locations of their pasts, \"haunting\" old hideouts and sometimes even resuming the depredations of murderers long dead, falling back on means of death and mayhem that were more comfortable in their breathing days. Such mohrgs are even more insane than most undead beings, and can sometimes be found wandering the streets of a city or town in cowls and cloaks, carrying on their old life\\'s work of slaughter and murder as best they can. Of course, since those slain by a mohrg rise soon thereafter as undead themselves, the murders of a mohrg do not go unnoticed for long, even when they take extra care to prey only upon society\\'s dregs. A sudden uprising of undead in the streets is the inevitable result of a mohrg\\'s attentions. Since these zombies remain under the mohrg\\'s control, and since the mohrg itself possesses a hateful and cruel intelligence, it often holds its undead army in reserve, even commanding it to lie motionless until several weeks or months have passed and the local graveyard is filled with the sleeping dead. Then, when the time is right, the mohrg calls upon its army to rise and aid it in finishing the slaughter.'},\n",

They no longer remember the civilized lives their ancestors led, although many morlock tribes still dwell in the shattered ruins of their ancient homes. Ironically, in many cases morlocks worship the statues left behind by these ancestors as their gods. Morlock priests of such ancestor worship have access to the domains of Darkness, Earth, Madness, and Strength. A typical morlock stands just over 5 feet tall and weighs roughly 150 pounds. Morlocks move about on two legs at times, but often drop down to a creepy four-limbed shuff le when speed or stealth is necessary. Their wiry, often emaciated frames mask the strength of their limbs and their swift reactions. Morlocks typically give birth to broods of three to four babies at a time, ravenous creatures born with a full set of teeth and a cannibalistic predisposition. The first few weeks of a brood's life must be carefully mothered to prevent attrition-it usually takes that long for the morlock young to overcome their natural inclination to feed on whatever is closest. Morlocks mature quickly, achieving adulthood after only 5 years of life. A typical morlock can live to a ripe old age of 60-although the majority of their kind die far sooner than that due to violence.\"},\n",

A pair of nagas might take up residence near a site they deem worthy of protection, hatching a brood and raising their offspring there. When the young grow to adulthood, they have the choice of departing to seek their own homes or staying to protect their elder's charge. Sometimes, a guardian naga protecting a ruin or temple is but the current protector in a line of sentinels stretching back centuries. Such sentinels often take the same name as their forebears to appear as a single, exceptionally long-lived figure.\"},\n",

       "   'description': 'Morbid-minded and wretched to look upon, spirit nagas are the witches of the naga race, hateful outcasts long shunned for their dark powers and loathsome ways. A typical spirit naga is slender, with the scales of a venomous serpent and a tangle of greasy hair framing their pale faces. Most measure 14 feet long but weigh less than 300 pounds. Spirit nagas delight in places of death and desolation. Battle-scarred ruins, untended graveyards, despoiled forests, and tangled swamps all attract these repulsive creatures. Where guardian nagas favor places of innate sanctity, spirit nagas seek out places of fundamental corruption, sites they believe to be imbued with dark magics. The crypts of long-dead tyrants, the death places of great heroes, and the ruins of nefarious keeps all attract these wretched serpents. Most spirit nagas believe themselves to be the inheritors of some mysterious dark favor, seeing their innate magical talents as evidence of such. Most commune with vague powers of death and devastation, working profane rites and seeking grotesque auguries from cultic forces. To aid them, spirit nagas often use their enchanting gaze, changing victims into fawning fanatics and would-be sacrif ices. Spirit nagas occasionally band together in small groups-some seeming to mimic the covens of hags. While a particular plot or foe might bring these deadly serpents together for a short time, spirit nagas are loyal only to themselves, and such alliances always end in deadly betrayal.'},\n",

       "   'description': \"Ochre jellies are animate masses of protoplasm hued a sickly combination of yellow, orange, and brown. At rest, their flat, pulsing bodies stand roughly 6 inches tall and can stretch out to a wide diameter-in motion, they often ball up into quivering spherical shapes and almost seem to roll as they move. Their malleable bodies allow them to seep through cracks and holes far smaller than the space they fill. Creatures dwelling below ground often attempt to seal up any such cracks to fortify their lairs against ochre jellies. An ochre jelly's highly specialized acid only dissolves flesh. This discovery has led many poisoners and hack alchemists to search out specimens for their tinkering. Some specialized weapons have resulted from these experiments that target the living body in wicked ways. Rumors of a slow-release poison that breaks down the cellular walls in living creatures surfaced a few years ago, but its creator guards the secret with his life. Notes in a long-forgotten tome mention a burial practice used in faraway places that resembles cremation. Instead of burning the corpse to ashes, the practitioners seal the body into a stone sarcophagus with an ochre jelly so it can dissolve the body. Afterward, the morticians place the ochre jelly into a large canopic jar, complete with a bronze plaque naming the deceased. This practice protects items entombed with the body (which is quickly reduced to nothing but a polished skeleton), and the creature's essence, it is believed, still rides along with the living jelly. Ochre jellies stand about 6 inches tall, spread out to a little over 10 feet in diameter, and weigh upward of 2,600 pounds. When in combat, they tend to pile up upon themselves and exude long, dripping pseudopods to slam and grapple anything that moves. Although the typical ochre jelly has stats as presented here, in the deepest reaches of the underground world these mindless predators can grow to enormous sizes. Perhaps more disturbing, though, are rumors of ochre jellies that have developed additional methods of capturing prey. Adventurers speak of jellies capable of poisoning foes with a touch or exuding clouds of noxious gas that burns the eyes and throat, leaving those who draw too near helpless as the immense protoplasmic beast slithers over their bodies and begins to feed.\"},\n",

Of rape and dismemberment, necrophilia, incest, mutilation, and all manners of hideous murder. Those who have not encountered ogres know the stories as warnings. Those who have survived such encounters know these tales to be tame compared to the truth. An ogre revels in the misery of others. When smaller races aren't available to crush between meaty fists or defile in blood-red lusts of violence, they turn to each other for entertainment. Nothing is taboo in ogre society. One would think that, left to themselves, an ogre tribe would quickly tear itself apart, with only the strongest surviving in the end-yet if there is one thing ogres respect, it is family. Ogre tribes are known as families, and many of their deformities and hideous features arise from the common practice of incest. The leader of a tribe is most often the father of the tribe, although in some cases a particularly violent or domineering ogress claims the title of mother. Ogre tribes bicker among themselves, a trait that thankfully keeps them busy and turned against each other rather than neighboring races. Yet time and again, a particularly violent and feared patriarch rises among the ogres, one capable of gathering multiple families under his command. Regions inhabited by ogres are dreary, ugly places, for these giants dwell in squalor and see little need to live in harmony with their environment. The borderland between civilization and ogre territory is a desperate realm of outcasts and despair, for here dwell the ogrekin, the deformed offspring and results of frequent ogre raids against the lands of the smaller folk. Ogre games are violent and cruel, and victims they use for entertainment are lucky if they die the first day. Ogres' cruel senses of humor are the only way their crude minds show any spark of creativity, and the tools and methods of torture ogres devise are always nightmarish. An ogre's great strength and lack of imagination makes it particularly suited for heavy labor, such as mining, forging, and clearing land, and more powerful giants (particularly hill giants and stone giants) often subjugate ogre families to serve them in such regards. A typical adult ogre stands 10 feet tall and weighs roughly 650 pounds.\"},\n",

As a culture, orcs are violent and aggressive, with the strongest ruling the rest through fear and brutality. They take what they want by force, and think nothing of slaughtering or enslaving entire villages when they can get away with it. They have little time for niceties or details, and their camps and villages tend to be filthy, ramshackle affairs filled with drunken brawls, pit fights, and other sadistic entertainment. Lacking the patience for farming and only able to shepherd the most robust and self-sufficient animals, orcs almost always find it easier to take what someone else has built than to create things themselves. They are arrogant and quick to anger when challenged, but only worry about honor so far as it directly benefits them to do so. An adult male orc is roughly 6 feet tall and 210 pounds. Orcs and humans interbreed frequently, though this is almost always the result of raids and slave-taking rather than consensual unions. Many orc tribes purposefully breed for half-orcs and raise them as their own, as the smarter progeny make excellent strategists and leaders for their tribes. Orc Characters Orcs are defined by their class levels-they do not possess racial Hit Dice. All orcs have the following racial traits. +4 Strength, -2 Intelligence, -2 Wisdom, -2 Charisma: Orcs are brutal and savage. Darkvision: Orcs can see in the dark up to 60 feet. Ferocity: See universal monster rules, page 300. Light Sensitivity: See universal monster rules, page 301.

Their lairs are middens, cesspools, offal pits, toxic swamps, and sewers-the greater a lair's filth, the greater the draw to the refuse-eating otyugh. They glory in the role of scavenger, wandering through vast underground caverns in search of the choicest cuts of garbage and waste. Upon finding such refuse, they gorge upon it, gathering what cannot be consumed in one debauch to bring back to their foul-smelling lairs. Otyughs spend most of their time in these filthy dens, which they keep constantly filled with carrion, dung, and worse sorts of stinking eff luvia. Intelligent creatures dwelling in subterranean areas near an otyugh often form a partnership of convenience with the disgusting beast. These creatures gladly provide their refuse and piles of raw meat to the otyugh, transforming the creature into an effective form of trash disposal. In return, the otyugh leaves its benefactors alone, and does not attack them, possibly even acting as a guardian. The most horrifying thing to most races about the notorious otyugh is not the nature of its diet or its choice of lairs, but rather that a creature with an otyugh's tastes can be anything other than a mindless scavenger. In fact, otyughs are surprisingly intelligent, and often quite eager to form alliances with those who offer them a steady supply of delicious diversions in the form of offal and waste. Most otyughs understand the fact that other creatures find them unpleasant and hideous, but few really care.\"},\n",

       "   'description': \"The origin of the owlbear is a subject of great debate among scholars of the monstrous creatures of the world. However, most concur that at some point in the distant past, a deranged wizard created the original specimens by crossing an owl with a bear-perhaps as proof of some insane concept about the nature of life, but possibly out of sheer lunacy. Whatever the original purpose of such a freakish creation as the owlbear, the creature bred true and has become quite wellestablished in woodlands across the world, where it plays a key role in a region's ecosystem as an apex predator. Owlbears are notoriously bloodthirsty killers, well known for their short tempers, aggression, and savage nature. They tend to attack without provocation, slaughtering any living creatures that cross their paths. Many scholars that have encountered these creatures in the wild have noted that they all have red-rimmed eyes that roll about wildly when they close in for an attack. This is sometimes presented as a sign of madness, suggesting that all owlbears are born with a pathological need to fight and kill, but more level-headed researchers believe that it's simply part of the way the massive bird-beast's keen eyes are constructed. Owlbears generally inhabit desolate areas of the wilderness, making their messy lairs within wild forests or inside dark, shallow caverns. They are equally adept at hunting during the day and at night, depending upon the prey available near their lairs. Adult owlbears live in mated pairs, and hunt in small groups, leaving their young behind in their lairs while they search for prey. A typical owlbear lair contains 1d6 juveniles, which can fetch a price of up to 3,000 gp apiece in many city markets. While it is considered impossible to truly domesticate owlbears due to their feral natures, they can still be used as guardians if contained within an area but allowed to roam and hunt freely there. Professional animal trainers charge up to 2,000 gp to rear or train an owlbear into a serviceable guardian that can obey simple commands (DC 23 for a juvenile creature; DC 30 for a fully grown adult). A full-grown male can stand as tall as 8 feet and weighs up to 1,500 pounds.\"},\n",

       "   'description': \"The pegasus is a magnificent winged horse that sometimes serves the cause of good. Though highly prized as aerial steeds, pegasi are wild and shy creatures not easily befriended. A typical pegasus stands 6 feet high at the shoulder, weighs 1,500 pounds, and has a wingspan of 20 feet. Most pegasi are white, though occasionally one is hatched with conventional horse colors and markings. The pegasus is, despite its appearance, as intelligent as a human. As such, those who try to train a pegasus to serve as a mount find the pegasus to be recalcitrant and even violent. A pegasus cannot speak, but it understands Common and greatly prefers the company of a good companion. The proper method to convince a pegasus to serve as a mount is to befriend it with diplomacy, favors, and good deeds. A pegasus is generally indifferent to a good-aligned creature, unfriendly to a neutral one, and hostile to an evil one-before a pegasus will serve as a mount, a pegasus must be made helpful via Diplomacy checks or other means. Riding a pegasus requires an exotic saddle or no saddle at all, as a regular saddle's straps interfere with the creature's wings. A pegasus can fight while carrying a rider, but the rider cannot also attack unless he or she succeeds on a Ride check. Trained pegasi are not afraid of combat, and the rider does not need to make a Ride check each round merely to control his mount. Pegasi lay eggs-they are worth 2,000 gp each on the open market, while young are worth 3,000 gp per head. However, as they are intelligent, good-aligned creatures, selling eggs and young is essentially slavery and is looked down on or outlawed in good societies. Pegasi mature at the same rate as horses. Professional trainers charge 1,000 gp to rear or train a pegasus, which serves a good or neutral master with absolute faithfulness for life. A light load for a pegasus is up to 300 pounds; a medium load, 301-600 pounds; and a heavy load, 601-900 pounds. In some pegasi, the blood of a mighty heroic stallion ancestor runs strong. These champions have the lifespan of a human, the advanced template, perfect flight maneuverability, fire resistance 10, a +4 racial bonus on saving throws against poison, and an immunity to petrification attacks. Some are able to speak a few words in Common or Celestial. They are fully aware of their superiority over common horses and pegasi, and need no training to fly with a rider, but only allow themselves to be ridden by great heroes.\"},\n",

       "   'description': \"Phase spiders are voracious predators from the Ethereal Plane who hunt on the Material Plane. When prey is located, the spider shifts to the Ethereal Plane to prepare an ambush. Against a lone victim, the spider shifts to the Material Plane, bites the victim, then retreats back to the Ethereal Plane to wait for the poison to take effect. Against multiple foes, a phase spider follows these same tactics, and on each round a foe remains in reach at the start of its turn, it repeats this gambit. If no foes are in reach, it moves while ethereal to prepare an attack on an available target, but unless it feels safe in spending an entire round on the Material, it won't phase back to attack unless it can do so while saving a move action for an escape. Phase spiders are the natural enemy of another denizen of the Ethereal Plane-the xill. The two races have long fought a bloody war with no real prospect of a resolution anytime soon. Were phase spiders less horrifying and alien in appearance, they might find the allies they need to defeat the sinister xill among other races, but their monstrous forms and often overwhelming hunger make diplomacy difficult. On the Ethereal Plane, phase spiders can manipulate the raw smoky ether in a manner similar to how a spider manipulates webs. Vast, complex nests of semisolid ether float idly through the eddies of the Ethereal Plane, each supporting numerous phase spiders. The creatures enjoy each other's company, but have no real concept of family-a newborn phase spider is fully capable of fending for itself and is treated no differently by its parents or siblings than any other. The typical phase spider is 8 feet long and weighs about 700 pounds.\"},\n",

Alternatively, you can change the types of effects that pixie dust can have on arrows-as a general rule, these alternate effects should be mind-affecting effects. Confusion, fear, hideous laughter, and hypnotism are all good choices for variant pixie arrow powers. You should take care when assigning alternate powers to a pixie, though, since doing so can create a threat that far exceeds what their physical statistics (and relatively low CR) can logically support.\"},\n",

       "   'description': \"Pseudodragons are tiny cousins of true dragons, and are playful but shy. They often only vocalize in chirps, hisses, growls, and purrs, but can communicate telepathically with any intelligent creature. If approached peacefully and offered food, they are usually willing to share information about what they've seen in their territory, but threats or violence make them flee. Pseudodragons are carnivores, devouring insects, rodents, small birds, and snakes, though they sometimes eat eggs, and most also enjoy butter, cheese, and fish. They either hunt on the ground like lizards or look for prey on the wing like a raptor. As smart as a typical humanoid, they do not enjoy being treated as pets and prefer being treated as friends. They are wary of evil folk but can bond with sorcerers and wizards as familiars, and some have befriended druids and rangers or partnered with good dragons as scouts. Pseudodragons will serve as familiars if they approve of a spellcaster's personality (and if the spellcaster takes the Improved Familiar feat), but often also bond with those whose company they enjoy or who have proven themselves true friends. A pseudodragon might follow another character in this manner for days, weeks, years, or even a lifetime if the creature is treated well, provided with food, and generally well-loved. Upon reaching adulthood, a pseudodragon's body is about 1 foot long with a 2-foot tail, and weighs about 7 pounds. A pseudodragon egg is the size of a chicken egg, but leathery and spotted brown, and a mating female lays 2-5 eggs every spring. A clutch of pseudodragons (the collective noun-not to be confused with pseudodragons from the same brood of eggs) usually consists of a mated pair and several near-adult offspring.\"},\n",

       "   'description': 'Purple worms are giant scavengers that inhabit the deepest regions of the world, consuming any organic material that they encounter. They are notorious for swallowing their prey whole. It is not uncommon to hear of a group of adventurers vanishing down the ravenous maw of a purple worm, screaming as they disappear one by one. Although they seek to consume living creatures, purple worms also consume vast amounts of dirt and minerals as they burrow underground. The insides of a purple worm may contain a considerable number of gemstones and other items able to withstand the corrosive acid inside its gullet. In areas filled with valuable minerals, such as those near dwarven mines, the natural tunnels created by burrowing purple worms are often filled with vast amounts of unrefined ores. A purple worm usually claims a large underground cavern as its den, and while it returns here to rest and digest food, it spends the majority of its time on the prowl, burrowing through the endless dark or slithering along established tunnels in the constant drive to feed its immense hunger. Although not completely mindless, purple worms are rather stupid. They make popular guardians for those who have the magic to control them or a chamber in their lair large enough to hold one captive. Although the deep-dwelling purple worm is the most common of its ilk, variant immense worms of differing colors dwell in other remote wildernesses. A sleek, mottled blue-and-green variant of the giant worm dwells in deep underground lakes or tropical seas (this variant loses its burrow speed but increases its swim speed to 40 feet). A deep crimson variant of even greater size dwells in remote badlands and rocky deserts (this variant is never less than Colossal in size). Other species doubtless remain to be discovered in the far corners of the world.'},\n",

They embody what is taboo among most societies, and in the shape of those it seeks to defile, a rakshasa gorges itself on these hideous acts. Were they human, these acts of cannibalism, blasphemy, and worse would mark them as criminals condemned to the cruelest of hells. When not disguised as a humanoid, the otherwise humanoid rakshasa has the head of an animal. Often, they possess the heads of great cats (such as a tiger or panther) or a snake (like a cobra or viper), yet other heads are not unknown-apes, jackals, vultures, elephants, mantises, lizards, rhinos, boars, and more are possible. In most cases, the type of head a rakshasa possesses speaks in some way to its personality-a tiger-headed rakshasa is stealthy and ravenous, while a boar-headed one might be gluttonous and crude. These changes rarely impact the rakshasa's base statistics, although there are more powerful variants of the standard rakshasa that possess multiple heads, more potent spellcasting powers, and additional deadly and unusual special abilities. Rakshasas scoff at religion-they understand the power of the divine, but see themselves as the only thing worthy of worship from the mortal races. Rakshasa clerics are thus quite rare. Although rakshasas are outsiders, they are also very much creatures of the Material Plane, and many believe the first rakshasas chose this exile over some other role offered them by a longforgotten god. Although they usually work alone, it isn't unheard of to find extended families of rakshasas working together to ruin a mortal civilization from the inside out over the course of many generations. A rakshasa is 6 feet tall and weighs 180 lbs.\"},\n",

While not capable of speech, the typical remorhaz has a good grasp of the Giant tongue, and tribes of giants often use this to their advantage to secure allegiances with the great beasts. Frost giants are particularly obsessed with them, for those giants who brave the cruel and deadly burns a remorhaz can inf lict to become \"worm friends\" gain a potent weapon to use against their enemies-an assassin capable of burrowing up through the floor of a glacial keep to strike directly against a frost giant\\'s greatest weakness: fire.

In the darkest corners of the Great Beyond, certain powerful demon lords have mastered the art of shaping the raw, protoplasmic flesh of the Abyss into hideous monstrosities devoid of life, emotion, and the will to resist control. The monstrous retriever is the best-known of such constructs, a huge spider-like creation capable of unleashing potent energy upon those it has been ordered to seek. Demon lords use retrievers to seek out those who dare abandon their loyalties or flee from servitude. Often, the presence of a retriever in a demon's den is enough in and of itself to ensure the loyalty of the lesser demons. The constructs also excel in tracking down specific objects and returning them to their masters-their intelligence is just enough to allow them to focus on their ordered tasks but not quite enough for them to form ideas of rebellion and longings for freedom. A retriever's body is the size of an elephant, and its legspan is nearly 30 feet. It weighs 6,500 pounds. Conjuring a Retriever Although a retriever is not an outsider, it may nonetheless be conjured by either greater planar ally or greater planar binding. The spellcaster must take care to do so, however, using special rare incenses and complex diagrams inked on the floor and walls using expensive phosphorescent inks, lest the retriever attack the spellcaster upon completion of the spell. These components cost 25,000 gp and replace the usual costs associated with casting either spell (including greater planar binding's Charisma check requirement).\"},\n",

       "   'description': \"Rocs are terrifying, legendary birds renowned for their ability to carry off elephants and other big animals. A typical roc is 30 feet long from beak to tail, with an 80-foot wingspan and weight of up to 8,000 pounds. While their beaks are hooked like an eagle's and designed for slashing and tearing, most rocs prefer to seize prey in their massive, clawed talons and drop them from great heights before feasting on the shattered remains. For this reason, they are often followed by flocks of scavengers like rooks, buzzards, and eagles hoping to steal portions of the roc's messy meals. The roc generally ignores such opportunists, but if the scavengers don't take care, they nevertheless may find themselves accidentally consumed by the feeding roc. Rocs are equally comfortable over land and sea. While they are capable of sleeping in the air as they soar solo across great ranges in search of food, they generally return home to the mountains to roost and procreate. They prefer rocky crags that are completely inaccessible by terrestrial means, building vast nests of tree trunks and ruined masonry. Once a decade, a mated pair lays a clutch of 3-5 eggs and raises its young. Outside of mating, rocs are extremely antisocial, and may attack others of their kind in vicious aerial battles in order to establish their territorial boundaries. When a nest contains eggs or chicks, parents trade off in their long-ranging flights, with one restricting its wanderings to within a 10-mile radius of the nest. Rocs are most commonly white but can be a number of different colors, from dark brown or gold to black or blood red. Their massive feathers are highly prized, and their eggs even more so. Due to their scarcity and the high risk involved in harvesting them, a single man-sized roc egg can net 4,000 gp if transported to market undamaged. A roc can be trained as well as any other animal, but its great size makes this a daunting task for most would-be trainers of human size. The same isn't true for giants-particularly cloud and storm giants, who often use trained rocs as guardians for their lairs. Rocs are even large enough to serve as mounts for the most prestigious of giants. Rocs taken as animal companions by druids or rangers are typically newly hatched birds-a baby roc is the size of a person and ready for flight and hunting within minutes of hatching. Unfortunately for druids seeking animal companions of legendary size, an animal companion roc is limited to Large size-still large enough for a Medium druid or ranger to use the flying beast as a mount.

Capable of altering the coloration and shape of its body, a roper in hiding looks remarkably like a stalagmite of stone or ice (or in low-ceilinged chambers, a stony or icy pillar). In areas without such features to hide among, a roper can compress its body into a much more squat, boulder-like shape. The strands it extrudes are not flesh but a thick, semiliquid material similar to partially melted wax but with the strength of an iron chain and the ability to numb flesh and sap strength. The roper can manipulate these strands with great finesse, and can fling them as far as 50 feet to snatch objects that attract its attention. Although alien and monstrous in shape, the roper is in fact one of the most intelligent denizens of the deep caverns of the world. They do not form large societies (although ropers can be found living among some deep-dwelling denizens like the intellect devourers or neothelids, with whom they have been known to sometimes ally), but often congregate in small clusters. Particularly interested in the philosophy of life and death and the finer points of the more cruel and sinister religions of the world, a roper can talk or argue for hours with those it initially sought merely to eat. Stories speak of particularly skilled debaters and philosophers who have been kept for days or even years as pets or conversational companions by roper clusters, but in the end, if such pets don't eventually escape, a roper's appetite always wins out over its intellectual curiosity-especially in cases where pets are constantly outmaneuvering their keeper's wits and patience.

Typically 5 feet long and weighing almost 200 pounds, the lobster-like rust monster would be frightening enough even without the alien feeding process that gives it its name. Rust monsters consume metal objects, preferring iron and ferrous alloys like steel but devouring even mithral, adamantine, and enchanted metals with equal ease. Any metal touched by the rust monster's delicate antennae or armored hide corrodes and falls to dust within seconds, making the beast a major threat to subterranean adventurers and those dwarven miners who must defend their forges and compete for ore. Though rust monsters have no innate tendency toward violence, their insatiable hunger leads them to charge anything they come across that bears even trace amounts of metal, and any resistance is met with unthinking savagery. It's not unheard of for rust monsters in metalpoor areas to track escaped victims for days using their scent metal ability, provided the victims retain intact metal objects. Fortunately, it's often possible to escape a rust monster's attentions by throwing it a dense metal object like a shield and running in the opposite direction. Those who frequent areas infested with rust monsters quickly learn to keep a few stone or wooden weapons close at hand.\"},\n",

Great cities raised by these creatures darken the deep ocean trenches, and many are the near-coastal fortresses where they launch endless raids against their air-breathing enemies who dwell in close proximity to the shore. Warlike and proud, the sahuagin rarely ally with others, and view most other aquatic races such as the aboleths, the merfolk, and their ilk as competitors. The only creatures they seem to respect and adore apart from their own kind are sharks, for in these relentless predators the sahuagin see much of themselves. A sahuagin stands 7 feet tall and weighs about 250 pounds. Sahuagin are prone to beneficial mutations, and when a mutant is born it almost always rises to the society's nobility or rulership. The most common sahuagin mutation is an extra pair of arms (granting two additional claw attacks or the opportunity to wield more weapons). Rumors speak of the rare malenti-sahuagin who look not like sharkmen but aquatic elves, yet who share their kin's bloodlusts and cruel natures. Malenti often serve as spies and assassins for sahuagin rulers, but rumors of allmalenti tribes in isolated reaches of the sea persist.\"},\n",

Because some of the stronger elemental fire races enslave salamanders for their metalworking skill and fighting prowess, the salamanders hate the efreet and other inhabitants with a passion. Though their lairs typically hover in temperatures of 500 degrees F or more, salamanders can tolerate lower temperatures. They generally do so only when forced, and are even surlier and more short-tempered than normal in such environments. Although they hail from the Plane of Fire, the salamander race identifies more with the Abyss, and they hold demons (particularly those associated with fire, like balors and certain fire-themed demon lords) in great esteem. It's not unusual to encounter large groups of salamanders in the Abyss as a result. Salamanders are often conjured to the Material Plane to serve as guardians or, more commonly, to craft weapons, armor, and other metalwork, for their skill in these areas is legendary. Salamanders also infest areas of the Material Plane where the boundaries between this world and the Plane of Fire have worn thin, such as in and near volcanoes. Because their habitat is so extreme, salamanders only save treasure that can withstand high temperatures, such as swords, armor, jewels, rods, and other items made from high-melting-point metals. Salamander society is a cruel one based on power and the ability to subjugate those beneath oneself. Beings beneath a salamander that cause it discomfort are dealt a slow and painful death.\"},\n",

Though their bodies are almost always those of attractive and well-built men, much of the satyrs' talent for seduction lies in their talent for music. With the aid of his eponymous pipes, a satyr is capable of weaving a wide variety of melodic spells designed to enchant others and bring them in line with his capricious desires. In addition to their constant frolicking, satyrs often act as guardians of the creatures in their forest homes, and any who manage to turn the satyr's lust to wrath are likely to find themselves facing down dangerous animals surrounding the faun. Still, while satyrs tend to value their own amusement well above the rights of others, they bear no ill will toward those they seduce. Children born from such encounters are always full-blooded satyrs, and are generally spirited away by their riotous kin soon after birth.\"},\n",

       "   'description': 'Giant scorpions are monstrous versions of the more common desert scorpion. They are likely to attack any creature that approaches. Giant scorpions usually charge when attacking, grabbing prey in their pincers, then lashing their segmented tails forward to kill their victim with injected venom. Giant scorpions are just over 8 feet long from head to the base of the tail; the tail adds an additional 8 feet or so, although it is usually curled up over the scorpion\\'s back. Giant scorpions weigh between 2,000 and 6,000 pounds. Giant scorpions normally feed on other giant vermin, as well as large mammals that they paralyze with their venom, but they will attack and eat any living creature that ventures too close. In turn, giant scorpions are preyed upon by purple worms and other large predators. Giant scorpions engage in complex courtship rituals when they mate, grasping each other\\'s pincers, arching their tails, and performing a circular \"dance.\" Soon after mating, the male usually retreats to avoid being cannibalized by the female. Female scorpions do not lay eggs; they give birth to live young in broods of a dozen or so. The mother carries her brood on her back until the young are old enough to fend for themselves and hunt their own prey. Giant scorpions live in underground burrows, either as solitary hunters or in small colonies, and will sometimes take up residence in man-made ruins or dungeons if food is plentiful. Giant scorpion colonies are usually made up of scorpions from the same brood that have yet to strike out on their own. Other species of scorpions exist as well, some smaller but most quite a bit larger and favoring different terrains, such as forests, plains, or even underground. You can adjust the stats for the giant scorpion by changing Hit Dice and size (adjusting Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution as appropriate) to represent a wide range of species. The following table lists the most common variants.

Sea hags prefer to dwell relatively close to shore where fishermen and trading vessels are more commonly encountered. Most choose to live far from urban areas so that their acts don't draw as much attention from would-be enemies, but it's not uncommon for a particularly brave or eager sea hag to settle in a city harbor or in the mouth of a deep river. Sea hags form covens similar to other hags, but their aquatic nature generally keeps them from forming mixed covens. In the case of a shorelinedwelling green hag (often a green hag who dwells in a saltmarsh or other coastal swampland), a coven often consists of two sea hags who look to the green hag as their mother and leader. More commonly, a sea hag coven consists of a group of particularly friendly and sisterly sea hags. See page 167 for more details on hag covens.\"},\n",

Yet proof of these immense and elusive creatures is remarkably difficult to come by, for not only is the ocean vast and the true sea serpent rare, but these creatures are quite adept at both avoiding capture and destroying ships bent on such a daunting task. Due to the sea serpent's hermitic nature, many sailors take to ascribing the sighting of such a beast to an omen, although whether the sighting portends peril or providence depends as much upon the ship's morale as it does anything else-the sea serpent itself has little interest in prophecy, and only its hunger determines how dangerous its proximity to a curious ship can be. Although sea serpents are little more than animals, they possess about them an air of mysticism that even old salts and cynics are forced to admit quickens the heart and buoys (or sinks) the spirit. Reports of sea serpent sightings are just as likely to encourage travel as they are to cause panic among seafarers, as explorers and adventurers flock to the site in hopes of sighting such a legendary creature. Typical sea serpents are 60 feet in length and weigh 4,500 pounds, but their upward size limit is unknown. Certainly, the sea is a vast and mysterious place more than capable of supporting whales and other such l e v i a t h a n s , and tales of sea serpents that exceed lengths of 300 feet or more are not unheard of. You can generate statistics for a sea serpent of such tremendous size by applying the advanced simple template or the giant simple template to the statistics presented here. Alternatively, you can advance this sea serpent to Colossal size, increasing its Hit Dice to 25 and its CR to 18.\"},\n",

They are actually intelligent, carnivorous plants with a fondness for elf flesh in particular. What serve as a shambler's brain and sensory organs are located in its upper body. Shambling mounds typically have an 8-foot girth and stand between 6 and 9 feet tall. They weigh about 3,800 pounds. Shambling mounds are strange creatures, more akin to animate tangles of creeping parasitic vines than single rooted plants. They are omnivorous, able to draw their sustenance from nearly anything, wrapping their creepers around living trees to draw forth the sap, sending rootlets into the soil to absorb raw nutrients, or consuming flesh and bone from crushed prey. Shamblers are frighteningly stealthy in their native environments. Blending in with the surrounding terrain, they can lie in wait for days on end without moving, waiting patiently for a potential meal. A shambler could be almost anywhere at any time, attacking without warning and not caring whether it leaves any survivors, so long as it acquires its next meal. Shambling mounds normally lead solitary, nomadic existences in deep forests and fetid swamps, although they can also be found underground living among damp fungal thickets. Disturbing rumors persist, however, of shamblers gathering in strange congregations around great earthen mounds in the depths of marshes and jungles, often during the height of violent electrical storms. Their reasons for doing so are unknown, and many sages have wondered whether there is some obscure and alien purpose at work.\"},\n",

       "   'description': \"A shocker lizard has a pale yellow underside, with bright green scales elsewhere on its 3-foot-long body, and weighs about 25 pounds. Shocker lizards tend toward group living, as their electrical abilities grow in power when they are close to another lizard. A shocker lizard colony is usually located near a source of water. Once the colony has settled on a location, the lizards become very territorial and attack anything that intrudes on them. A solitary shocker lizard is a timid and hesitant creature-but when several of them gather they become formidable and fearsome opponents capable of killing creatures several times their own size. A shocker lizard relies on its electricity abilities in combat, and a lizard tends to bite only after its shock has rendered an opponent unconscious, or when the shock seems to have no effect at all. A solitary lizard flees once it delivers its shocks, but if other shocker lizards are nearby, they all hone in on their comrade's discharges and attempt to administer lethal shocks to their foe. Many have attempted to capture and tame shocker lizards, but this often proves a difficult and painful task. Alone and in captivity, shocker lizards tend to wither and die swiftly unless their keepers spend a lot of time grooming and playing with the lizards to keep them company. Kept in pairs or larger numbers, captive shocker lizards thrive, but their increasing electrical ability makes them more difficult to manage for keepers who aren't themselves immune to electricity.\"},\n",

The first shoggoths were created in eons past, long before the first gods turned their attentions to the Material Plane. Some hold that the aboleths engineered them, while certain strange texts hint of a race even older that engineered the first shoggoths as slaves. Eventually, these dread beasts developed enough intelligence to rebel against their creators, and now they lurk, patient but potent, in the lightless deep.'},\n",

       "   'description': 'Skeletons are the animated bones of the dead, brought to unlife through foul magic. While most skeletons are mindless automatons, they still possess an evil cunning imparted to them by their animating force-a cunning that allows them to wield weapons and wear armor. Creating a Skeleton \"Skeleton\" is an acquired template that can be added to any corporeal creature (other than an undead) that has a skeletal system (referred to hereafter as the base creature). Challenge Rating: Depends on Hit Dice, as follows: HD CR XP 1/2 1/6 65 1 1/3 135 2-3 1 400 4-5 2 600 6-7 3 800 8-9 4 1,200 10-11 5 1,600 12-14 6 2,400 15-17 7 3,200 18-20 8 4,800 Alignment: Always neutral evil. Type: The creature\\'s type changes to undead. It retains any subtype except for alignment subtypes (such as good) and subtypes that indicate kind (such as giant). It does not gain the augmented subtype. It uses all the base creature\\'s statistics and special abilities except as noted here. Armor Class: Natural armor bonus changes as follows: Skeleton Size N atural Armor Bonus Tiny or smaller +0 Small +1 Medium or Large +2 Huge +3 Gargantuan +6 Colossal +10 Hit Dice: A skeleton drops any HD gained from class levels and changes racial HD to d8s. Creatures without racial HD are treated as if they have 1 racial HD. If the creature has more than 20 Hit Dice, it can\\'t be made into a skeleton by the animate dead spell. A skeleton uses its Cha modifier (instead of its Con modifier) to determine bonus hit points. Saves: Base save bonuses are Fort +1/3 HD, Ref +1/3 HD, and Will +1/2 HD +2. Defensive Abilities: A skeleton loses the base creature\\'s defensive abilities and gains DR 5/bludgeoning and immunity to cold. It also gains all of the standard immunities and traits possessed by undead creatures. Speed: A winged skeleton can\\'t use its wings to fly. If the base creature flew magically, so can the skeleton. All other movement types are retained. Attacks: A skeleton retains all the natural weapons, manufactured weapon attacks, and weapon proficiencies of the base creature, except for attacks that can\\'t work without flesh. A creature with hands gains one claw attack per hand; the skeleton can strike with each of its claw attacks at its full attack bonus. A claw attack deals damage depending on the skeleton\\'s size (see pages 301-302). If the base creature already had claw attacks with its hands, use the skeleton claw damage only if it\\'s better. Special Attacks: A skeleton retains none of the base creature\\'s special attacks. Abilities: A skeleton\\'s Dexterity increases by +2. It has no Constitution or Intelligence score, and its Wisdom and Charisma scores change to 10. BAB: A skeleton\\'s base attack bonus is equal to 3/4 of its Hit Dice. Skills: A skeleton loses all skill ranks possessed by the base creature and gains none of its own. Feats: A skeleton loses all feats possessed by the base creature and gains Improved Initiative as a bonus feat. Special Qualities: A skeleton loses most special qualities of the base creature. It retains any extraordinary special qualities that improve its melee or ranged attacks. Environment: Any, usually the same as base creature. Organization: Any. Treasure: Generally none, although sometimes a skeleton\\'s creator arms it with magical armor or weapons. Variant Skeletons Numerous variant skeletons exist, such as those whose bones burn with an unending fire and those who drip with gore and reassemble themselves over time. Both of these variant skeletons can be created using animate dead, but they count as twice their normal number of Hit Dice per casting. Once controlled, they count normally against the controller\\'s limit. Perhaps the most dangerous variant skeleton, though, is the skeletal champion. This skeleton retains its intellect, and often any class levels it possessed in life. A skeletal champion cannot be created with animate dead-these potent undead only arise under rare conditions similar to those that cause the manifestation of ghosts or via rare and highly evil rituals. Each of the following skeleton types modifies the base skeleton in a few key ways. Except as noted, these variations can be stacked with one another-it\\'s possible to have a bloody burning skeletal champion. Bloody Skeleton A bloody skeleton is coated in a slick layer of blood and gore infused with negative energy. This gore allows the skeleton to reform and heal itself. In addition to the changes for the skeleton template, make the following adjustments to the base creature. Challenge Rating: As a normal skeleton +1. Fast Healing: A bloody skeleton has fast healing equal to 1 per 2 Hit Dice it possesses (minimum 1). Saves: A bloody skeleton gains channel resistance +4. Abilities: A bloody skeleton\\'s Charisma is 14. Special Qualities: A bloody skeleton gains the deathless special quality. Deathless (Su): A bloody skeleton is destroyed when reduced to 0 hit points, but it returns to unlife 1 hour later at 1 hit point, allowing its fast healing thereafter to resume healing it. A bloody skeleton can be permanently destroyed if it is destroyed by positive energy, if it is reduced to 0 hit points in the area of a bless or hallow spell, or if its remains are sprinkled with a vial of holy water. Burning Skeleton A burning skeleton is surrounded by an aura of flames that deals fire damage to those it strikes. In addition to the changes for the skeleton template, make the following adjustments to the base creature. Challenge Rating: As a normal skeleton +1. Aura: Burning skeletons possess a fiery aura. Fiery Aura (Ex): Creatures adjacent to a burning skeleton take 1d6 points of fire damage at the start of their turn. Anyone striking a burning skeleton with an unarmed strike or natural attack takes 1d6 points of fire damage. Defensive Abilities: Burning skeletons lose their immunity to cold but gain immunity to fire. A burning skeleton gains vulnerability to cold damage. Melee Attacks: A burning skeleton\\'s melee attacks (including both those made with a natural weapon and those made with a manufactured weapon) deal an additional 1d6 points of fire damage. Abilities: A burning skeleton\\'s Charisma is 12. Special Qualities: A burning skeleton gains fiery death. Fiery Death (Su): A burning skeleton explodes into a burst of flame when it dies. Anyone adjacent to the skeleton when it is destroyed takes 1d6 points of fire damage per 2 Hit Dice the skeleton possessed (minimum 1d6). A Ref lex save (DC = 10 +1/2 the skeleton\\'s Hit Dice +the skeleton\\'s Cha bonus) halves this damage.'},\n",

For the most part, the skum have been less than successful at this endeavor, and today they exist in a shadow of their previous multitude, most of them dwelling deep underground in slowly crumbling ruins left standing only because their enemies have lost interest in pursuing the now-won war against these fish-like humanoids. Skum have even lost their own name-only the most erudite and wise of their kind remember that they were once known as the ulat-kini. Today, most identify themselves with the racial epithet applied to them by surface-dwellers-\"skum.\" Skum do not age, and barring death by violence or disease, they can live forever. Unfortunately, this near immortality is crippled by the fact that skum are incapable of reproducing among themselves, for all skum are male. The aboleths did not want their slave race to prosper without their permission. Yet terribly, this does not mean that skum cannot breed. Originally created from human stock, skum can impregnate humans, and the children issued from such unholy unions are invariably deformed. Those who are not born skum undergo gradual transformations throughout their lives, and when they would normally die of old age, such hybrids instead go through \"the change,\" shedding their wrinkled flesh and transforming into one of the ulat-kini. While most skum tribes lack the drive to perpetuate their race and would prefer to languish in their hideous sunken ruins, tribes settling offshore of remotely populated coastlines seem to be on the rise. Some such communities raid villages for breeding stock, but a few more insidious tribes form alliances with these desperate folk, providing protection and bounty from the sea in return for wives.'},\n",

Folk who dwell near swamps and other regions that support giant slugs risk losing livestock and even their homes to these enormous beasts. Giant slugs constantly wander in search of food, their preference being fleshy organic material, which they slice into smaller, easily gulped chunks with their rasp-like tongues. What strange inf luence might have caused the first giant slugs to grow to such monstrous proportions is unknown, but today, giant slugs breed true and birth their oversized offspring after a fleshy, squirming courtship ritual. After mating, a female giant slug lays just over a hundred eggs, each approximately a foot in diameter. The mother slug guards this clutch fiercely and aggressively attacks any creatures that wander too close. Giant slugs inhabiting swamps aboveground mate once a year, and those who live in the area know better than to go into the swamps during this month. Deep below ground, some subterranean races use giant slugs as mounts or guardians. Creatures like mites, who have a strange empathy with vermin, can be used to keep giant slugs docile, but in most cases, those who would use giant slugs must do so with great care, keeping them well fed until they are needed for battle. Frightened whispers report armies of troglodytes using giant slugs as siege mounts. One particularly disturbing tale mentions a vast underground cavern inhabited by scores of skum and aboleth-controlled aquatic giant slugs with strange, mind-numbing abilities infused into their acidic saliva.'},\n",

Nevertheless, the sinuous creatures are held in fear by many societies who often ascribe fiendish qualities to them. The constrictor snake presented here is a relatively small one. You can create stats for a larger maneater like an anaconda by applying the advanced and giant simple templates, or by advancing the stats above to a 7 HD Large snake (CR 5), or even a 14 HD Huge snake (CR 10).'},\n",

They are fond of hiding near watering holes and waiting for travelers to drop their guard, then swooping out to attach and drink their fill by thrusting their long feeding tubes into unprotected veins. After feeding they flap heavily off into the mud and reeds to lay their eggs and rest until hunger drives them to hunt again. Stirges are usually 1 foot long, with a wingspan of twice that, and weigh just under a pound.

A svirfneblin\\'s ties to the eerie realm of the fey are much stronger than those of their surface-dwelling gnome kin, and this makes them either strangely detached from their emotions or violently random in their outbursts.

Small: Svirfneblin are Small creatures and gain a +1 size bonus to their AC, a +1 size bonus on attack rolls, a -1 penalty to their CMB and CMD, and a +4 size bonus on Stealth checks. Defensive Training: Svirfneblin gain a +2 dodge bonus to Armor Class. Senses: Svirfneblin have darkvision 120 ft. and lowlight vision. Fortunate: Svirfneblin gain a +2 racial bonus on all saving throws. Skilled: Svirfneblin gain a +2 racial bonus on Stealth checks; this improves to a +4 bonus underground. They gain a +2 racial bonus on Craft (alchemy) checks and Perception checks. Hatred: Svirfneblin receive a +1 bonus on attack rolls against humanoid creatures of the reptilian and dwarven subtypes due to training against these hated foes. Stonecunning: Svirfneblin gain stonecunning as a dwarf (Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook 21). Spell Resistance: Svirfneblin have SR equal to 11 +class levels. Svirfneblin Magic: Svirfneblin add +1 to the DC of any illusion spells they cast. Svirfneblin also gain the spell-like abilities listed above; caster level equals the svirfneblin\\'s class levels. Languages: Svirfneblin begin play speaking Gnome and Undercommon.

Even humanoids are far from safe, especially in cases where a tiger has developed a taste for humanoid flesh. Tigers prefer terrain with plenty of cover and proximity to water as their hunting grounds. While the tiger itself is a fearsome predator, its strength and ferocity pales in comparison to that of the larger dire tiger. Known to many scholars as the smilodon and to tribal societies as the saber-toothed tiger, the dire tiger is invariably one of the region's top predators. Its defining feature is a pair of huge incisors that hang down like fearsome knives from the upper jaw, protruding menacingly even when the creature's mouth is shut.

As long-lived as the forests themselves, and seeing themselves as parents and shepherds rather than gardeners, treants are slow and methodical in most things but terrifying when forced to fight in defense of their flock. Though they rarely seek out the companionship of the short-lived races, and have an inherent distrust of change, they have been known to tolerate those who seek to learn from their long, rambling monologues, especially if the pupils express a desire to help protect the wildlands. Yet against those who would threaten the forest, especially loggers who seek to harvest wood for lumber or those who try to clearcut a section of forest in order to build a fort or establish a town, the treants' wrath is swift and devastating. They are particularly gifted at tearing down what others build-a trait that serves angry treants well. Treants are primarily solitary creatures, with a given individual sometimes responsible for an entire forest, but they occasionally come together in small groups called groves to share news and reproduce. In times of grave danger, all of the groves in a region may gather for a great months-long meeting called a moot, but such events are exceedingly rare, and millennia may go by between them. The typical treant is 30 feet tall, with a trunk 2 feet in diameter, and weighs 4,500 pounds. Treants tend to resemble the species of trees most common in their woodland territories.\"},\n",

They are among the most populous denizens of the upper reaches of the endless caverns of the underworld, equally at home raiding the settlements of those who dwell above or below ground, yet for all their race's fecundity and sprawl, as a whole they represent only a minor threat. At times, great leaders can draw legions of troglodytes to their command to create vast and deadly armies, but left to their own devices, troglodyte tribes are content to keep each other under control with numerous feuds, cannibalistic raids, and bitter civil wars. The troglodyte is one of the oldest of intelligent races, and ruins found in some remote caverns testify to the fact that their empire was once among the largest in the world. At the dawn of time, the troglodyte civilization was generations ahead of other humanoid races-while those races hid in caves and worshiped fire, the troglodytes raised vast cities of stone ziggurats and twisting canals, kept other races as slaves, and worshiped ancient and inhuman gods and demons. Yet as the other races evolved and grew increasingly civilized, they outstripped their onetime troglodyte oppressors. Today, the roles have changed-now it is the troglodyte that hides in caves and lives the life of a feral savage. Religion is strong among troglodyte tribes, and their shamans and priests are universally the highest regarded members of a clan. A troglodyte chieftain is not always a cleric or druid, but those who do not have divine power are usually mere mouthpieces and puppet lords that answer to the beck and call of the local seer or shaman. Troglodytes generally worship one of the countless demon lords, particularly those of a reptilian or primeval shape and form or those whose Abyssal domains most closely resemble the tangled caverns troglodytes prefer. Troglodyte druids are usually neutral evil if they dwell with their own kind (and are universally feared and respected for the eerie command they have over beasts). A typical troglodyte stands about 5 feet tall and weighs 150 pounds.\"},\n",

       "   'description': \"Trolls possess incredibly sharp claws and amazing regenerative powers, allowing them to recover from nearly any wound. They are stooped, fantastically ugly, and astonishingly strong-combined with their claws, their strength allows them to literally tear apart flesh to feed their voracious appetites. Trolls stand about 14 feet tall, but their hunched postures often make them appear shorter. An adult troll weighs around 1,000 pounds. A troll's appetite and its regenerative powers make it a fearless combatant, ever prepared to charge headlong at the nearest living creature and attack with all of its fury. Only fire seems to cause a troll to hesitate, but even this mortal threat is not enough to stop a troll's advance. Those who commonly battle with trolls know to locate and burn any pieces after a fight, for even the smallest scrap of flesh can regrow a full-size troll given enough time. Fortunately, only the largest part of a troll regrows in this way. Despite their cruelty in combat, trolls are surprisingly tender and kind to their own young. Female trolls work as a group, spending a great deal of time teaching young trolls to hunt and fend for themselves before sending them off to find their own territories. A male troll tends to live a solitary existence, partnering with a female for only a brief time to mate. All trolls spend most of their time hunting for food, as they must consume vast amounts each day or face starvation. Due to this need, most trolls stake out large territories as their own, and fights between rivals are quite common. While these are usually nonlethal, trolls are aware of each others' weaknesses and will use such knowledge to kill their own kind if food is scarce. Scrags Dwelling in both fresh and salt water, these cousins of the troll have the aquatic subtype and the amphibious special quality. Scrags have a base land speed of 20 feet and a swim speed of 40 feet. A scrag's regeneration ability only works if it is in contact with water. Scrags dwell in any body of water in any climate, though they are most common in cold northern rivers and lakes, and are less bestial in appearance than their terrestrial cousins, though no less violent.\"},\n",

They universally shun all creatures except for good-aligned fey, good-aligned humanoid women, and the woodlands' native animals, though they may fight alongside other good creatures against common enemies. A typical unicorn is 8 feet long and 5 feet tall at the shoulder, weighing 1,200 pounds. Unicorns mate for life, and the pairs generally make their homes in specific glades or dells within the vast forests they protect (these regions can cover anywhere from a few dozen square miles to hundreds). They allow good and neutral creatures to pass through, hunt for food, or reside in their woods unharmed, but evil creatures and those who damage the local ecosystem more than necessary through sport hunting or commercial logging are swiftly driven out or killed. On rare occasions, lone unicorns without mates or whose partners have been slain have been known to adopt young women of exceptionally pure virtue as surrogates, allowing the women to ride on their backs and becoming their guardians and protectors for life. This bond generally ends amiably if the woman becomes more committed to someone else-such as a lover or child-giving rise to the myth that unicorns only befriend virgins. A unicorn's horn is the focus for its powers, and in order to use its spell-like abilities on other creatures the unicorn must touch them with it. Evil creatures greatly value unicorn horns as reagents for healing potions and other dark rites, and a single powdered unicorn horn counts as 1,600 gp when used as a component for crafting healing magic.\"},\n",

       "   'description': 'Vampires are undead humanoid creatures that feed on the blood of the living. They look much as they did in life, often becoming more attractive, though some have a hardened, feral look instead. Creating a Vampire \"Vampire\" is an acquired template that can be added to any living creature with 5 or more Hit Dice (referred to hereafter as the base creature). Most vampires were once humanoids, fey, or monstrous humanoids. A vampire uses the base creature\\'s stats and abilities except as noted here. CR: Same as the base creature +2. AL: Any evil. Type: The creature\\'s type changes to undead (augmented). Do not recalculate class Hit Dice, BAB, or saves. Senses: A vampire gains darkvision 60 ft. Armor Class: Natural armor improves by +6. Hit Dice: Change all racial Hit Dice to d8s. Class Hit Dice are unaffected. As undead, vampires use their Charisma modifier to determine bonus hit points (instead of Constitution). Defensive Abilities: A vampire gains channel resistance +4, DR 10/magic and silver, and resistance to cold 10 and electricity 10, in addition to all of the defensive abilities granted by the undead type. A vampire also gains fast healing 5. If reduced to 0 hit points in combat, a vampire assumes gaseous form (see below) and attempts to escape. It must reach its coffin home within 2 hours or be utterly destroyed. (It can normally travel up to 9 miles in 2 hours.) Additional damage dealt to a vampire forced into gaseous form has no effect. Once at rest, the vampire is helpless. It regains 1 hit point after 1 hour, then is no longer helpless and resumes healing at the rate of 5 hit points per round. Weaknesses: Vampires cannot tolerate the strong odor of garlic and will not enter an area laced with it. Similarly, they recoil from mirrors or strongly presented holy symbols. These things don\\'t harm the vampire-they merely keep it at bay. A recoiling vampire must stay at least 5 feet away from the mirror or holy symbol and cannot touch or make melee attacks against that creature. Holding a vampire at bay takes a standard action. After 1 round, a vampire can overcome its revulsion of the object and function normally each round it makes a DC 25 Will save. Vampires cannot enter a private home or dwelling unless invited in by someone with the authority to do so. Reducing a vampire\\'s hit points to 0 or lower incapacitates it but doesn\\'t always destroy it (see fast healing). However, certain attacks can slay vampires. Exposing any vampire to direct sunlight staggers it on the first round of exposure and destroys it utterly on the second consecutive round of exposure if it does not escape. Each round of immersion in running water inf licts damage on a vampire equal to onethird of its maximum hit points-a vampire reduced to 0 hit points in this manner is destroyed. Driving a wooden stake through a helpless vampire\\'s heart instantly slays it (this is a full-round action). However, it returns to life if the stake is removed, unless the head is also severed and anointed with holy water. Speed: Same as the base creature. If the base creature has a swim speed, the vampire is not unduly harmed by running water. Melee: A vampire gains a slam attack if the base creature didn\\'t have one. Damage for the slam depends on the vampire\\'s size (see pages 301-302). Its slam also causes energy drain (see below). Its natural weapons are treated as magic weapons for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction. Special Attacks: A vampire gains several special attacks. Save DCs are equal to 10 +1/2 vampire\\'s HD +vampire\\'s Cha modifier unless otherwise noted. Blood Drain (Su): A vampire can suck blood from a grappled opponent; if the vampire establishes or maintains a pin, it drains blood, dealing 1d4 points of Constitution damage. The vampire heals 5 hit points or gains 5 temporary hit points for 1 hour (up to a maximum number of temporary hit points equal to its full normal hit points) each round it drains blood. Children of the Night (Su): Once per day, a vampire can call forth 1d6+1 rat swarms, 1d4+1 bat swarms, or 2d6 wolves as a standard action. (If the base creature is not terrestrial, this power might summon other creatures of similar power.) These creatures arrive in 2d6 rounds and serve the vampire for up to 1 hour. Create Spawn (Su): A vampire can create spawn out of those it slays with blood drain or energy drain, provided that the slain creature is of the same creature type as the vampire\\'s base creature type. The victim rises from death as a vampire in 1d4 days. This vampire is under the command of the vampire that created it, and remains enslaved until its master\\'s destruction. A vampire may have enslaved spawn totaling no more than twice its own Hit Dice; any spawn it creates that would exceed this limit become free-willed undead. A vampire may free an enslaved spawn in order to enslave a new spawn, but once freed, a vampire or vampire spawn cannot be enslaved again. Dominate (Su): A vampire can crush a humanoid opponent\\'s will as a standard action. Anyone the vampire targets must succeed on a Will save or fall instantly under the vampire\\'s inf luence, as though by a dominate person spell (caster level 12th). The ability has a range of 30 feet. At the GM\\'s discretion, some vampires might be able to affect different creature types with this power. Energy Drain (Su): A creature hit by a vampire\\'s slam (or other natural weapon) gains two negative levels. This ability only triggers once per round, regardless of the number of attacks a vampire makes. Special Qualities: A vampire gains the following. Change Shape (Su): A vampire can use change shape to assume the form of a dire bat or wolf, as beast shape II. Gaseous Form (Su): As a standard action, a vampire can assume gaseous form at will (caster level 5th), but it can remain gaseous indefinitely and has a fly speed of 20 feet with perfect maneuverability. Shadowless (Ex): A vampire casts no shadows and shows no ref lection in a mirror. Spider Climb (Ex): A vampire can climb sheer surfaces as though under the effects of a spider climb spell. Ability Scores Str +6, Dex +4, Int +2, Wis +2, Cha +4. As an undead creature, a vampire has no Constitution score. Skills Vampires gain a +8 racial bonus on Bluff, Perception, Sense Motive, and Stealth checks. Feats Vampires gain Alertness, Combat Ref lexes, Dodge, Improved Initiative, Lightning Ref lexes, and Toughness as bonus feats. Vampire Spawn A vampire can elect to create a vampire spawn instead of a full-f ledged vampire when she uses her create spawn ability on a humanoid creature only. This decision must be made as a free action whenever a vampire slays an appropriate creature by using blood drain or energy drain. A vampire spawn\\'s statistics are identical to those of a wight, save for the following changes. • It gains the blood drain and dominate vampire special attacks. • It gains channel resistance +2, DR 5/silver, resist cold and electricity 10, fast healing 2, and the vampire qualities listed above (gaseous form, shadowless, and spider climb). • It does not gain the Create Spawn ability. • A vampire spawn gains all of the standard vampire weaknesses. • A vampire spawn is CR 4.'},\n",

Vargouilles are not natives of the Material Plane but can often be found there nevertheless, occupying graveyards, ancient battlefields, or anywhere one can find remnants of death and decay. These hideous monsters come from the fiendish outer planes, where they flop and flap through strange and haunted skies in constant search of fresh souls to torment. In these nightmare realms, vargouilles play a role similar to that of a raven or vulture, although they augment these roles with a malevolent delight in causing pain and anguish that no scavenger bird could ever hope to match. Vargouilles attack by swooping in on their opponents, shrieking them into paralysis, and then biting them with rows of razor-sharp teeth. When multiple vargouilles take up a common cause and fight as allies, they overwhelm their victim with bites and shrieks, tearing it to shreds. A vargouille's low power and hideous method of reproduction make for a dangerous combination. Vargouilles are relatively easy to summon to the Material Plane, and once here, they can swiftly reproduce, creating more and more of their hideous kind from those who fall victim to their kiss. Vargouilles created on the Material Plane in this manner are still extraplanar creatures, and as such can be banished with the right magic.\"},\n",

       "   'description': 'Vegepygmys are created by a dangerous fungus known as russet mold-creatures slain by russet mold serve as incubators for the mold\\'s spores, and a day later, the dead body bursts to release 1d6 fully grown vegepygmys. A vegepygmy has no real relation to the body from which it emerges, but the creature may yet retain a strange sort of reverence for its \"birth corpse\" and carry with it a grisly memento from the body, typically a few bones or teeth. Often, a vegepygmy uses such bones to craft a crude spear or some other weapon. Vegepygmy tribes live in tightly knit communities and fiercely guard their patches of russet mold. Vegepygmies cannot speak-they communicate via a crude language of rhythmic taps, beats, and clicks. Hunting parties echo these exchanges through the caves they travel. Vegepygmies stand 2 to 4 feet tall and weigh between 15 to 45 pounds. Approximately 1 in 20 vegepymies are chieftains. A vegepygmy chieftain is an advanced vegepygmy (often one with class levels) that carries an infestation of russet mold spores in its flesh. A vegepygmy chieftain infects any creature it hits with its natural weapons with russet mold spores (see below). Russet Mold (CR 6) This hazardous fungus can be found in dark, wet areas, and often grows in great abundance at the heart of a vegepygmy lair. When a creature approaches within 5 feet of a patch of russet mold, the fungus releases a cloud of spores in a 5-foot radius burst. Everyone in the area must make a DC 15 Fortitude save or the spores quickly take root in their victims, inf licting 2 points of Constitution damage per round. A new Fortitude save can be attempted each round to halt the growth. Although immunity to disease won\\'t protect against russet mold spores, the growth can be halted by remove disease and similar effects. Exposure to sunlight also halts the spores\\' growth. Plants are immune to russet mold spores. After 24 hours, a fully grown vegepygmy bursts from the body of any creature slain by russet mold, provided the creature was Small or larger. For each size category larger than Small, the body produces one additional vegepygmy. A patch of russet mold is unharmed by all effects save for acid, alcohol, or remove disease (or a similar magical effect, such as heal), all of which can kill a single patch of russet mold on contact. Sunlight doesn\\'t kill the mold, but does render it dormant and harmless as long as the sunlight persists.'},\n",

       "   'description': \"The violet fungus is one of the most notorious and feared dangers of the world's caves. A traveler can often see signs of the violet fungus in those who dwell or hunt in places where these carnivorous fungi lurk. In these folk, deep and hideous scars mar bodies where entire furrows of flesh seem scooped away-the marks of a close encounter with a violet fungus. A violet fungus feeds on the rot and decay of organic matter, but unlike most fungi, they are not passive consumers of corruption. A violet fungi's tendrils can strike with unexpected swiftness, and are coated with a virulent venom that causes flesh to rot and decay with nauseating speed. This potent poison, if left untreated, can cause the flesh of an entire arm or leg to drop away in no time at all, leaving behind only warm bones that soon rot into corruption as well. Although violet fungi are mobile, they only move to attack or to hunt for prey. A violet fungus that has a steady supply of rot to sup upon is generally content to remain in one place. Many underground-dwelling cultures take advantage of this penchant, particularly troglodytes and vegepygmies, and keep multiple violet fungi in key junctions and entrances to their caverns as guardians, making sure to keep them well fed with carrion to prevent them wandering farther into the den in search of food. Some species of shriekers (Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook 416) are relatively similar in appearance to violet fungi, although they lack the tentacular branches. It's not uncommon to find shriekers and violet fungi growing in the same grove-especially in areas where other creatures cultivate the fungi as guardians. A violet fungus is 4 feet tall and weighs 50 pounds. Violet Venom Although a violet fungus's tentacles swiftly grow inert after the mushroom is slain, they can be wielded as Medium-sized whips for 2d6 minutes after being harvested from the creature. These whips inf lict rot on anything they touch-including the wielder of the deadly weapon-and both save DCs to resist and effects are identical to the stats presented above. A DC 25 Craft (alchemy) check and 250 gp worth of reagents can preserve the venom somewhat, although the procedure dilutes it signif icantly. Violet Venom: Poison-contact; save Fort DC 13, frequency 1/minute for 6 minutes, effect 1d2 Strength and 1d2 Con damage; cure 1 save; cost 800 gp.\"},\n",

Giant wasps attack when hungry or threatened, stinging their prey to death. They take dead or incapacitated opponents back to their lairs as food for their unhatched young-the experience of lying in a wasp nest, paralyzed while its grubs feed, is one of nature's cruelest inventions.

       "   'description': \"Wights are humanoids who rise as undead due to necromancy, a violent death, or an extremely malevolent personality. In some cases, a wight arises when an evil undead spirit permanently bonds with a corpse, often the corpse of a slain warrior. They are barely recognizable to those who knew them in life; their flesh is twisted by evil and undeath, the eyes burn with hatred, and the teeth become beast-like. In some ways, a wight bridges the gap between a ghoul and a spectre-a warped animated corpse whose touch steals living energy. As undead, wights do not need to breathe, so they are sometimes found underwater, though they are not particularly good swimmers unless they were originally swimming creatures such as aquatic elves or merfolk. Underwater wights prefer low-ceilinged caves where their limited swimming isn't as much of a liability. The wight presented here is a typical example of its kind, but sometimes when a wight creates spawn from particularly unusual humanoids, the resulting wights are quite different in power, such as the following three variants. Brute Wight (CR 5): Giants that are killed by wights become hunchbacked, simple-minded undead. Brute wights are giant advanced wights, but cannot create spawn of their own. Cairn Wight (CR 4): Some societies deliberately create these specialized wights to serve as guardians for barrows or other burial sites. A cairn wight is an advanced wight that fights with a weapon, typically a sword, that channels its energy drain attack and affects creatures damaged by the weapon as if they had been struck by the wight's slam attack. Frost Wight (CR 4): Wights created in cold environments sometimes become pale undead with blue-white eyes and ice in their hair. Frost wights have the cold subtype and their slam attacks deal 1d6 cold damage in addition to the normal effects. A creature touching a frost wight with natural weapons or unarmed strikes takes 1d6 cold damage.\"},\n",

Evil creatures that feed on the strong psychic emanations of terrified creatures, will-o\\'-wisps delight in tempting gullible travelers into dangerous situations. In the wild lands where they\\'re most common, will-o\\'-wisps favor simple tactics like positioning themselves over cliffs or quicksand where they can easily be mistaken for lanterns (especially if they can set their traps near actual signal lanterns), allowing them to lure unwary travelers into perilous situations. On rare occasions, will-o\\'-wisps seeking easier pickings will move into a city and take up residence near gallows or follow along invisibly behind an army in order to harvest the fear of the dying men; why the vast majority choose to remain in the swamps where victims are scarce remains a mystery. Will-o\\'-wisps only use their electric shock ability under extreme duress, preferring to let other creatures or hazards claim their victims while they float nearby and feast. Will-o\\'-wisps can glow any color they choose, but are most frequently yellow, white, green, or blue. They can even vary their luminosity to create patterns-many will-o\\'-wisps are fond of creating vague skull-like shapes in their glow to further terrify their victims. Their actual bodies are barely visible globes of translucent spongy material 1 foot across and weighing 3 pounds, capable of emitting light from every surface. A will-o\\'-wisp\\'s light is approximately as bright as a torch, and though they do not seem to use sound to communicate with each other, they hear perfectly and can vibrate their bodies rapidly to simulate speech. While vilif ied by most other sentient creatures, will-o\\'-wisps are actually quite intelligent, if utterly alien in their reasoning. Sometimes organized into groups called \"strings,\" their society and goals remain complete unknowns to outsiders, as do their origins, though they have sometimes been known to strike bargains with those who can offer them vast quantities of appropriately frightened victims. As will-o\\'-wisps do not age, and are effectively immortal unless killed by violence, particularly ancient will-o\\'-wisps can serve as fantastic repositories of knowledge from the ancient past, although convincing one of these cruel creatures to cooperate with an interrogation can be a trick in and of itself.'},\n",

A wolf 's wide paws contain slight webbing between the toes that assists in moving over snow, and its fur is a thick, water-resistant coat ranging in color from gray to brown and even black in some species. Its paws contain scent glands that mark the ground as it travels, assisting in navigation as well as broadcasting its whereabouts to fellow pack members. Generally, a wolf stands from 2-1/2 to 3 feet tall at the shoulder and weighs between 45 and 150 pounds, with females being slightly smaller.\"},\n",

They are always aggressive and impatient, and are quick to resort to force in order to accomplish their goals. For this reason, dragons generally look down upon wyverns, considering their distant cousins nothing more than primitive savages with a distinct lack of style or wit. In most cases, this generalization is spot-on. Although far from animalistic in intellect, and capable of speech, most wyverns simply can't be bothered with the subtlety of diplomacy, and prefer to fight first and parley later, and even then only if faced with a foe they can neither defeat nor flee from. Wyverns are territorial creatures. Though they occasionally hunt in small groups for large prey, they are generally solitary creatures, hunting in areas ranging in size from 100 to 200 square miles. Wyverns have been known to fight to the death among themselves for the right to hunt a territory rich with prey. Although constantly hungry and prone to mayhem, a wyvern that can be befriended (usually through a delicate combination of flattery, intimidation, food, and treasure) becomes a powerful ally. They often serve giants and monstrous humanoids as guardians, and some lizardfolk and boggard tribes even use them as mounts, although such arrangements are quite costly in terms of food and gold, for few are the wyverns who would willingly serve as steeds for lesser creatures for long. A wyvern is about 16 feet in length, half of which is tail. The average wyvern weighs 2,000 pounds.\"},\n",

       "   'description': \"Strange creatures as big around as they are tall, xorns have little interest in natives of the Material Plane-except for the gems and precious metals they might be carrying. Lurking beneath the surface for what might seem long stretches of time to humans, a xorn might wait months, even years, for the right treat to come along, assaulting the being carrying its favorite meal, such as a certain gemstone or the right sort of silver. Adventurers who frequent regions inhabited by xorns often carry with them small chunks of raw ore or relatively inexpensive gemstones or crystals to use as bribes. While the price of a gemstone or piece of metal is often in direct proportion to the object's flavor and desirability as a meal, most xorns are quite gluttonous and prefer quantity over quality when it comes to food Treasure found carried by a xorn or stashed in its lair amounts to little more than snacks set aside for another day. An offering of a particularly delicious (and expensive) jewel or piece of precious metal can swiftly secure a xorn's temporary allegiance. Since xorns can swim through solid rock with ease, they make excellent guides in underground regions. Xorns grow in size as they age. The youngest xorns are approximately 3 feet in size, and can be represented by applying the young simple template to the statistics presented here. The most commonly encountered xorns are about 5 feet tall (and wide), while the largest are 8 feet or more and weigh upward of 9,000 pounds. These elder xorns are giant advanced xorns, but some even greater xorns exist as well, with upward of 15 Hit Dice. Often, an elder xorn possesses class levels as well. These creatures are generally leaders, heroes, or even outcasts or villains in xorn society. A classed elder xorn typically has levels in barbarian or rogue. Xorns aren't particularly religious, but those who do have deep faith are typically druids (though such xorns rarely, if ever, take animal companions, as such followers cannot follow through solid rock, and instead choose to take the Earth domain). Xorn bards and sorcerers are not unheard of either, with bards favoring Perform (sing) as their focus, and sorcerers almost invariably having the Elemental (earth) bloodline.\"},\n",

They lope through the night skies, relentlessly pursuing their chosen quarry for miles, and harrying them with their frightful baying. Yeth hounds hunt only at night. They fear the sun and never venture out in daylight, even if their lives depend on it. A yeth hound stands 4 feet tall at the shoulder and weighs about 400 pounds. Yeth hounds do not collect treasure, having no use for such baubles. The thrill of the hunt and the sweet tang of fear in their prey is all they value. However, some items of worth may occasionally be found in a yeth hound den, the discarded remnants of prey dragged back to the lair. Despite their bestial appearance, the yeth hound is rather intelligent, even if it does little with its intellect but devise and carry out ingenious, hateful plans to torment and horrify its prey before it finally strikes. Yeth hounds can often be found in the company of night hags or evil hunters. Yeth hounds hate other canine monsters such as barghests and worgs, and attack them on sight if they have the advantage of numbers. They are often associated with particularly bestial demons, and can be found serving demon cults as guardians and trackers. A gift of a yeth hound companion to a particularly successful cult is sure sign of favor in the eyes of a demonic patron. A cult with yeth hounds granted to them in this manner must take care to retain this favor, for if they displease their demonic patron, the hounds could turn on them. Yeth hounds inhabit secluded dens in remote wilderness areas far from bothersome civilization. These dens are always subterranean, far removed from the hated sunlight. Yeth hounds range great distances from their dens during their nightly hunts, and have been known to carry kills for miles just for the comfort of consuming a fresh meal in their lair. The sight of a yeth hound loping through the sky with a body clenched in its jaws is unsettling indeed.'},\n",

Although yeti stories are accurate in their portrayals of fierce, stealthy, and immensely strong creatures, they are not when it comes to ascribing the yeti\\'s temperament and source. They dwell in small tribes atop their distant mountains, where they are sheltered from contact with most other races. Those with violent or cruel natures are usually forced out of tribes to live lonely lives as exiles, and without the support of a tribe such yeti are often driven to raiding lowlander settlements, thus perpetuating the myth of the yeti as a demon made flesh. The source of such cruel madness can often be traced to a singular source-proximity to strange, eldritch dimensions. The yetis\\' mountain lairs rise high in places where the boundaries between this world and others rasp thin. It is unclear if the yeti are invaders from these dimensions or Material Plane natives inf luenced by otherworldly realms, but it seems certain that whatever their origins, the yeti are no friends to those who dwell beyond, and may even act as guardians against intrusions from such strange worlds into the Material Plane.'},\n",

While the most commonly encountered zombies are slow and tough, others possess a variety of traits, allowing them to spread disease or move with increased speed. Zombies are unthinking automatons, and can do little more than follow orders. When left unattended, zombies tend to mill about in search of living creatures to slaughter and devour. Zombies attack until destroyed, having no regard for their own safety. Although capable of following orders, zombies are more often unleashed into an area with no command other than to kill living creatures. As a result, zombies are often encountered in packs, wandering around places the living frequent, looking for victims. Most zombies are created using animate dead. Such zombies are always of the standard type, unless the creator also casts haste or remove paralysis to create fast zombies, or contagion to create plague zombies.

Saves: Base save bonuses are Fort +1/3 HD, Ref +1/3 HD, and Will +1/2 HD +2. Defensive Abilities: Zombies lose their defensive abilities and gain all of the qualities and immunities granted by the undead type. Zombies gain DR 5/slashing. Speed: Winged zombies can still fly, but maneuverability drops to clumsy. If the base creature flew magically, so can the zombie. Retain all other movement types. Attacks: A zombie retains all the natural weapons, manufactured weapon attacks, and weapon prof iciencies of the base creature. It also gains a slam attack that deals damage based on the zombie\\'s size, but as if it were one size category larger than its actual size (see pages 301-302). Special Attacks: A zombie retains none of the base creature\\'s special attacks. Abilities: Str +2, Dex -2. A zombie has no Con or Int score, and its Wis and Cha become 10. BAB: A zombie\\'s base attack is equal to 3/4 its Hit Dice. Skills: A zombie has no skill ranks. Feats: A zombie loses all feats possessed by the base creature, and does not gain feats as its Hit Dice increase, but it does gain Toughness as a bonus feat. Special Qualities: A zombie loses most special qualities of the base creature. It retains any extraordinary special qualities that improve its melee or ranged attacks. A zombie gains the following special quality. Staggered (Ex): Zombies have poor ref lexes and can only perform a single move action or standard action each round. A zombie can move up to its speed and attack in the same round as a charge action. Variant Zombies The typical zombie is a slow-moving abomination that is tough to destroy. Yet this tough zombie is not the only type of zombie to plague crypts or stalk graveyards. Each of the following two variant zombies modif ies the base zombie in a few simple ways. Fast Zombie Unlike the standard, plodding zombie, a fast zombie moves with a supernatural quickness. Speed: Increase the base creature\\'s land speed by 10 feet. Defensive Abilities: A fast zombie does not gain DR 5/ slashing. Special Attacks: A fast zombie gains the following special attack. Quick Strikes (Ex): Whenever a fast zombie takes a fullattack action, it can make one additional slam attack at its highest base attack bonus. Abilities: As a standard zombie, except its Dexterity is increased by 2 instead of reduced by 2. Special Qualities: A fast zombie does not gain the staggered special quality. Plague Zombie These zombies carry a terrible disease that perpetuates their undead lineage-those infected by a plague zombie\\'s contagion rise as zombies themselves when they perish. Defensive Abilities: A plague zombie does not gain DR 5/slashing. Special Attacks: A plague zombie gains the following special attacks. Death Burst (Ex): When a plague zombie dies, it explodes in a burst of decay. All creatures adjacent to the plague zombie are exposed to its plague as if struck by a slam attack and must make a Fortitude save or contract zombie rot. Disease (Su): The slam attack-as well as any other natural attacks-of a plague zombie carries the zombie rot disease. Zombie rot: slam; save Fort DC = 10 +1/2 the zombie\\'s Hit Dice +the zombie\\'s Cha modif ier; onset 1d4 days; frequency 1/day; effect 1d2 Con, this damage cannot be healed while the creature is infected; cure 2 consecutive saves. Anyone who dies while infected rises as a plague zombie in 2d6 hours.'},\n",

       "   'description': 'Shadowgarms are strange monsters from the Plane of Shadow, where they function as lowly predators and pests somewhat akin to the Material Plane\\'s coyotes, leopards, and similar hunting mammals. Yet to a creature unfamiliar with the workings of the Plane of Shadow, the shadowgarm is a hideous and frightening beast. Generally lairing in ruined sections of towns or dead-end alleys clogged with refuse during the day, they come out at night to prey upon creatures that stray too far from the safety of light. These aberrant predators \"leak\" into the Material Plane anywhere the Plane of Shadow\\'s influence is strong. Small groups of shadowgarms are occasionally seen lurking in old graveyards where undead (particularly shadows) are known to reside, and anywhere that has strong traditions of shadow magic tends to have a healthy population of shadowgarms lurking in out-of-the-way areas as well. The typical shadowgarm measures about 4-1/2 feet long and weighs approximately 90 pounds, their bodies being strangely light, composed of a spongy dark matter and seemingly wisps of shadow itself. Some, however, grow to be much larger, though shadowgarms of all sizes prove especially adept at blending in among the shadows and detritus of their hunting grounds or crawling into crevices it seems creatures of their size would not be able to squeeze. Ecology Strange beings with a little-understood physiology, shadowgarms prove endlessly hungry, taking sustenance from shadow as if it were water and drawing nutrition from the flesh of other creatures as their only source of food. Shadowgarms can eat and digest any sort of animal matter, from flesh to bone, converting them into little more than smoke and shadow. A creature left to a shadowgarm to feed upon leaves behind nothing but trappings of metal and similarly solid accessories. A shadowgarm\\'s physical form seems strangely fluid, proving slightly malleable and generalized. No two shadowgarms appear exactly alike, and even individuals of the race seem to gradually change, all the faster in areas of deep shadows. Regardless of their endless, fluid alterations, they retain three primary clawed appendages, which serve them in consuming meals and fighting. Their number of feelers or tentacle-like legs, however, is constantly in flux, numbering but two or three one moment and then multiplying to dozens the next. Shadowgarms do not have a mouth and hardly have heads to speak off-possessing only slight knobby protuberances that seem to have little role in guiding their motions. When ingesting matter, they slowly dissolve their meals, their bodies breaking down any organic substance they choose by resting upon their meal for a matter of moments. The entire process might be likened to a body-wide ingestion process similar to that of a fly, as matter is dissolved and subsumed by the shadowy hunter\\'s bulk. Once every several months, the urge to mate descends upon shadowgarms like a mass racial insanity. At this time, their natural aversion to their own kind is overwhelmed by a need to procreate. Shadowgarms are hemaphroditic, but cannot fertilize themselves-when a shadowgarm gathering begins, these creatures congregate in groups of up to a dozen, remaining in close proximity to each other for days at a time. The cycle that drives shadowgarm gatherings is nothing connected to the Material Plane-most scholars have been unable to determine what pattern the timing follows, if indeed there is a pattern at all. Habitat & Society Although shadowgarms are quite active at all times on the Plane of Shadow, the realities of the Material Plane force them into the niche of nocturnal predator. Yet despite their hatred of light, they seem to need it in some strange way. Observers have noted that the creatures prefer to stand in actual shadows, rather than just in darkness, and seem to savor the ever-changing nature of the shadows themselves. It may be that shadowgarms abhor total darkness as much as light, though neither bright light nor utter darkness causes them physical harm. Most shadowgarms\\' hunts take place under the light of the full moon, or in the shadowy hours of dusk or dawn. In cities where shadowgarms are common, they naturally gravitate to sewers or narrow alleys. This allows them the easiest way to quickly strike at unwary victims from above or below. They do not build any sort of true nest or lair, preferring to remain constantly afoot in search of new prey. As shadowgarms have no fear of falling, they often clamber up to corners and niches at the tops of tunnels or just under rooftop overhangs, both to avoid any bright light that might be shining down from above and to lie in wait to ambush unsuspecting prey that walks underneath. This leads to the discovery of shadowgarms in truly unexpected and unnerving places, like in bell towers, within attics and crawl spaces, and even hidden amid cracks and loose shingles in old roofing. More than one child\\'s tale of boogiemen or strange shapes lurking outside their windows might actually be attributed to the daring nocturnal wanderings of shadowgarms. Shadowgarms are incredibly territorial, and usually do not nest together except during their mating gathering. Shadowgarms immediately confront one another upon meeting. Pickpockets and other street urchins often share wild tales of shadowgarms battling fiercely in the alleyways and nighted dens, fighting with raw savagery instead of their more customary stealth. Some canny streetfolk use this territorial nature to trick competing shadowgarms into fighting each other, giving wanderers out after dark enough time to move through territories infested by these lurking hunters without being attacked. Of course, this tactic doesn\\'t work well in areas where large numbers of shadowgarms are known to skulk, as directing one\\'s attention to avoid a single hunter might prevent a traveler from noticing other predators lying in wait in the shadows. On rare occasions, a shadowgarm might take to the seas, stealing aboard a ship at dock and hiding in the hold. Once at sea, such hunters emerge nightly to prey upon the ship\\'s crew. Since a shadowgarm melts away into shadow and fog when it dies, leaving no evidence of a corpse behind, this might be one explanation for mysteriously derelict ships found adrift on the waves with nothing living on board.'},\n",

       "   'description': \"Maniacal and clever, ukobachs embody the tenacity and ever advancing genius of Hell. Legions of these tiny devils labor throughout the it, and from their efforts rise new heresies and tools of depravity. They revel in the fires of Hell and manipulate them not toward destruction, but to the creation of ever greater and more innovative diabolical ends. The keepers of Hell's furnaces, they delight in their mad work, breaking only to torment the damned with their burning tools or newest inventions. Ukobachs stand approximately 3-1/2 feet tall and weigh 70 pounds on average. Their fire pokers are fundamentally tied to their beings and disintegrate in a flash of cinders and ash upon the devil's death. These tools hold up to 10 fistsized embers, which an ukobach can fling at its enemies. Ecology Born from the burning depths of Hell, ukobachs find themselves most at home amid the choking and sultry pits where mortals dare not delve, proving well adapted to such stifling environs. While they must breathe, they prove equally well adapted to breathing smoke, cinders, and steam as air. Like all devils, the ukobachs' infernal eyes gaze through even the most stygian night, but unlike their brethren, they dislike the dark. While they harbor no fear of darkness and certainly see its value when tormenting mortals, they view it largely as a waste, seeking to dispel even the most fleeting shadow with an explosion of flame. Habitat & Society Most ukobachs originate from the flaming canals of Dis or the fiery pits of Phlegethon. Although rarely born from Moloch's crematoriums at the heart of Citadel Ba'al, hordes of ukobach furnace keepers tend the flames of the archdevil's ceremonial ovens. Devastating ukobach engineers also tinker in the foundries at the heart of Phlegethon, creating ingenious devices of intentional or incidental immolation-some infernal rumors claim a particularly insidious ukobach inspired the invention of the first fireworks, leaving these devils with a universal love of such creations. On the mortal plane, ukobachs gravitate to cities. While many metropolises prove ill prepared to defend against the flames these devils delight in spreading, most ukobachs take more subtle approaches, finding lairs in abandoned smithies, large furnaces, stone ruins, and other places likely to survive the occasional errant flame. While indisputably pyromaniacal, ukobachs are more than merely crazed marauders. Seeing a small hovel, pile of leaves, or alley cat burn is nothing to creatures born from the flames of Hell. Rather, they enjoy the order and progression of flames, exalting in striking the spark that ignites a wildfire, upturning the lantern that sets a whole city quarter aflame, or immolating the leader whose death results in the dispersal of a formerly devout congregation. Further satisfying their methodological obsessions, ukobachs prefer setting elaborate traps for their victims over direct combat, often turning whole structures into burning deathtraps, trapping and retrapping the same location, or setting obvious snares that cause their quarries to overlook more devious ambushes. These impish devils understand the use of flammable fluids and materials well, often employing barrels of oil, casks of alcohol, heaps of coal, and even alchemical items like tindertwigs in their creations. Among diabolists, it is said that all ukobachs know the secret of creating berith, an alchemical element by which any material might be distilled into gold. Stories tell of ukobachs trading knowledge of this element for wild prices or only after an alchemist gathers components from exotic lands. Such tales often offer blatant moral lessons and warnings against these unnatural obsessions, such as the Taldan author and former alchemist Smardina's cryptic and symbol-laden work Shagreen, wherein an obsessed alchemist adventures across the world and ultimately trades an ukobach 23 years of his life, only to find his age and journeys have made his hands too crippled to work-he dies soon after and is dragged to Hell in a golden coffin. Summoning Ukobachs Ukobachs prove unusually congenial when it comes to answering the summons of many diabolists, especially those with an obvious creative streak, interest in alchemy, or queries regarding the inventions of Hell. Any diabolist who draws the magic circle necessary to bind an ukobach with mercury or silver powder, or who lights their diabolical summoning with chemical fire rather than normal oil or tinder, increases how difficult an ukobach finds it to escape from the magical trap by +2. Additionally, a diabolist gains a +2 bonus on the opposed Charisma check made to obtain an ukobach's service if the task involves creating alchemical or metallurgical works, or otherwise involves fire. In addition, ukobachs who know and favor their summoner sometimes bring gifts with them from Hell. While on the surface such boons might seem like blessings, they are always carefully selected by an ukobach and meant to encourage a summoner toward a destructive end. Commonly, such infernal gifts take the form of fireworks and explosives-especially in lands where such creations are uncommon-inscrutable blueprints or formulas for fiendish devices or magic items, or powerfully volatile alchemical reagents.\"},\n",

       "   'description': \"Prince-killers and assassins of souls, salikotals serve as the bloody chisels by which the lords of Hell subtly shape the mortal world to their whims. Soaring through the night on silent wings, these murderous devils care nothing for life or reason, knowing only a single, murderous goal. Cloaked by shadow and silence, few ever glimpse the sharp features of a salikotal, for Hell's death-dealers reveal themselves only amid the haze of fading life. Lean, deft hunters, salikotals move like terrible predatory birds, each taloned step measured, cautious, and full of deadly intent. Protected by an armor of sharp, thin scales, these agile devils universally stand 5 feet, 4 inches tall, and weigh 85 pounds, their barbed frames supporting the breadth of their 8-foot-wide, bat-like wings. They have full control over their slender tails, nimbly manipulating objects and even wielding deadly, Hell-forged blades in these dexterous, prehensile appendages. Ecology Salikotals rise from the tenebrous reaches of Erebus's vaulted heights. Unblinking and endlessly patient, salikotals haunt the claustrophobic upper realms of the lightless labyrinth, stealthy and watchful but caring little for the doings of intruders or their lesser kin. Only the summons of conjurers or the diabolical elite rouse them from their eerie aerial stalkings, drawing them forth from the shadows for a chance to hone their death-dealing expertise in the name of Hell. Naturally silent, salikotals never vocalize even the slightest sound, relying on their innate telepathic abilities for communication. Even when using such mental interaction, though, the devils prove terse and resistant to conversation. For most summoners, a salikotal's only communication is a slow nod acknowledging its orders, and a nod in answer to the question of its murderous success. Habitat & Society Salikotals have little to do with others of their kind, be they other salikotals or other lesser devils in general. Emotionless and rigid even beyond the typical disciplines of Hell, these assassins realize they exist for but a single reason: to sow death. Their cold precision only wavers when they discuss payment for their most notorious murderous methods, wherein they demand specific types of gemstones in compensation for their grisly work. Few non-devils dare to suppose why salikotals request such precise payments, refusing to work for any other recompense, but among the damned spread rumors of vast vaults filled with glistening jewels, each a fabulous treasure and a representation of a life cut short by the blades of Hell. Summoning Salikotals As in all things, salikotals prove emotionless when it comes to being summoned. They have little reason to purposefully resist or accept a diabolist's call, unless ordered to do so by their infernal masters. Once a salikotal is summoned, though, only murder interests it. Any Charisma check made as part of the spell planar binding to convince a salikotal to undertake a mission other than assassination takes a -2 penalty. Once a salikotal has agreed to perform a murder for its summoner, it explains the signature vengeances its kind can inflict upon a victim and offers to exact one upon its summoner's victim for an associated price. The devil requests 1,000 gp for every Hit Die its target possesses (intrinsically gauging its victim's prowess), to be paid entirely in one of three types of gemstones: ruby for fideicide, onyx for necrocide, and jacyinth for omnicide. Salikotals prove exceedingly particular in these payments, and if a summoner cannot pay the price in the type of gem requested, the devil refuses to exact one of its vengeances. If the summoner tries to force a salikotal to use one of its vengeances, the devil takes offense and all of the summoner's Charisma-related interactions with it in the future take a -2 penalty.\"},\n",

       "   'description': 'The Hand of the Inheritor is a warrior angel, first to answer Iomedae\\'s call whenever she must directly intervene on Golarion. As fast as the greatest angels, he leads the charge when her celestial armies must go to war. A veteran of countless sorties into the Abyss, the Hand fights with a song of battle on his lips and unbreakable courage in his heart. He looks like a tall, golden-skinned angel with a halo of sword-like blades, which he can also wear on his arm like a spiked shield. He may manifest or hide a pair of feathered wings at will, which may be any color, though he does not actually need them to fly. The Hand is not a diplomatic angel, and Iomedae rarely calls upon him when the situation requires someone willing to mince words. He once served the Empyreal Lord Ragathiel (at which time he was called the Hand of Vengeance) but asked to serve Iomedae after Aroden died, as she needed a hero to be her champion. Ecology The Hand of the Inheritor does not need to eat or sleep, though he is known to take a long pause after a great battle to think about fallen comrades with other veterans. He refers to Iomedae as \"My Lady, the Just Queen of Heaven,\" and treats her as if he were a knight holding a chaste adoration for a righteous courtly lady. His haloshield is called the Brightsword, and he sometimes refers to it as if it were an independent being, though it acts according to his will; as a free action he can pull a +2 longsword from the halo-shield at any time and wield it as a weapon, though the sword vanishes if ever separated from him. Habitat & Society The angel focuses on honorable combat, the preservation of just rulers, and valorous deeds. When he is not needed on Golarion, he guards noble souls through the Astral to Pharasma\\'s court, patrols the borders of Iomedae\\'s realm in search of abominations from the Abyss, duels devils on neutral ground to better learn their tactics, and watches over youths his patron has marked for greatness. He enjoys battle hymns and marching music, though his voice is more suited for harmonizing with a true performer than leading a song. He is adept at determining if a rampaging monster intends evil or if it is merely hungry, and is merciful enough to only slay the ones intending to do wrong. Likewise, he feels no guilt in slaying those who embrace evil, but strikes to subdue when his opponent is magically controlled or otherwise compromised in his decision-making. Though he is actually older than Iomedae, he defers to her divine wisdom and experience as a mortal, for he understands his perspective as an immortal angel living in the realms beyond Golarion is very different and sometimes emotionally distant from the thoughts and concerns of humanity. He is an ally of the heralds of Sarenrae and Shelyn, but is wary of the herald of Cayden Cailen, for that one\\'s overt sexuality makes him slightly uncomfortable (as he spent thousands of years serving the Empyreal Lord of chastity). Heralds of the Gods: Revisited The Hand of the Inheritor stands among a special class of unique, godly servants known as heralds. With few exceptions, every one of Golarion\\'s deities has its own herald, a favored minion that serves as a messenger and emissary throughout the planes and upon the mortal realm. While not necessarily the most powerful of a deity\\'s minions, heralds embody fundamental elements of a god\\'s faiths and philosophies, and thus prove particularly suited to interactions with mortal worshipers-although a herald appears only at the direct order of a deity, not merely because a powerful cleric requires aid. Thus, heralds are creatures myth, and their appearances mark lives and events of legend. In the Pathfinder RPG, heralds are unique outsiders of approximately CR 15 with 18 or fewer Hit Dice, making them available for summons via the spell greater planar ally. Only a deity\\'s worshipers can summon its herald; thus, even the most powerful worshiper of Sarenrae can never summon the Hand of the Inheritor. In addition, only divine spellcasters can summon heralds, preventing arcane casters and spells like planar binding from effectively calling upon such beings. Even if a character proves powerful enough to call out to a herald, a deity has the final say in whether or not its emissary answers a worshiper\\'s summons, granting its herald\\'s service only to followers in the most extreme need or whose acts directly further its will. Currently, the statistics for eight heralds have appeared in Pathfinder Adventure Paths, while all of these divine emissaries are described in Pathfinder Chronicles: Gods & Magic.

       "   'description': \"Man-eating birds of prey, the rare creatures known as stymphalides stalk the arid plains and coastlines of Golarion in ravenous swarms, shredding warm-blooded animals and unwary travelers with their bladed feathers and dagger-like beaks. From a distance, stymphalides might easily be mistaken for cranes, ibises, or other longnecked birds, though in full sunlight their gleaming feathers and the haze of blood lingering from past meals are impossible to mistake. Peculiarly, the feathers and beak of a stymphalides are made of steel, similar to the metallic hide of a gorgon. The wings of stymphalides are as sharp as knives and often lacerate their prey as the birds swarm and beat their wings against their unfortunate victims' skin. Similarly, their beaks are supernaturally sharp and can pierce the tough hides of animal prey or the armor of those warriors foolish enough to hunt the creatures. Even if a victim of a stymphalides swarm's frenzied attacks manages to fend off the vicious creatures, the wounds caused by the birds continue to bleed long after being inflicted, and the victim often perishes from loss of blood before ever reaching help. Most stymphalides stand approximately 2-1/2 feet tall and weigh little more than 40 pounds. Although mean-tempered and territorial, lone stymphalides prove relatively harmless, thus traveling in swarms of several dozen, relying on strength of numbers to bring down large or dangerous prey. Many tales also tell of enormous breeds of these monstrous birds, powerful enough to prey upon wyverns. These giant stymphalides are said to grow up to 13 feet tall and weigh over 250 pounds, with wingspans reaching upward of 25 feet. Such gigantic stymphalides are rarely seen, preferring to lurk upon desolate cliffs or even amid harsh extraplanar realms. Ecology Unlike vultures and other birds of the deserts and plains, stymphalides do not scavenge carcasses, although they are not above driving away natural scavengers if a large, fresh kill looks particularly inviting. When traveling in flocks, stymphalides prove fearless predators, swooping in and swarming any creature that wanders into their territory. The birds actively hunt their prey, harrying and killing lone individuals or stragglers. The attacks of a stymphalides swarm often prove so vicious that the creatures can take to flight once they have wounded prey, wait for it to bleed to death, and return to pick the corpse clean. Stymphalides generally avoid attacking large groups of people, unless the birds have gathered in a particularly sizable flock. Stymphalides are not purely carnivorous. A lone stymphalides might resort to eating fruit and other plants if it is separated from its flock or food is scarce, and orchards and fields of crops have been devastated by stymphalides when great swarms of the birds, starving from overpopulation or lack of prey, migrate to new territories. Yet although the birds are omnivorous, they seem to prefer meat. Those plainsfolk or desert-dwellers whose livelihoods depend on livestock have learned to fear the sight of flocks of birds silhouetted against the sky, as herds of cattle and other grazing animals have been ravaged by their swarms. Habitat & Society Most swarms of stymphalides roost near watering holes, rivers, and coastal cliffs, preying upon unfortunate creatures desperate enough to seek food or water so near to the dangerous birds' nests. The nests of stymphalides are frequently made from the bones of the creatures' prey, piled into macabre ziggurats upon which entire flocks of the birds rest. Particularly large flocks of the birds construct enormous nests, and giant stymphalides can create towers visible for miles. When not at rest, flocks of the creatures soar high on warm currents of air, relying upon their keen eyesight to spot suitable prey far below. Because of their voracious appetites, flocks of stymphalides must claim a vast swath of territory to maintain their feeding habits. Stymphalides are fiercely territorial, and flocks of the birds frequently fight with one another in swooping aerial battles to determine possession of land. Fortunately for the folk of civilized lands, stymphalides rarely encroach upon areas well traveled by humanoids and other creatures clever enough to bring down one of these metal-winged avians. Among the people of the plains, the metallic birds are often regarded as nearly legendary creatures. Stymphalides breed at an astonishing rate, however, and overpopulation and exhaustion of game frequently force extraordinarily large and deadly groups of the creatures to band together in search of new lands and new prey to devour.\"},\n",

What once appeared to be a small, rocky island reveals itself to be a creature of titanic proportions as an enormous tail lifts ominously from the water. With a thunderous crash, it slams down, sending the island plunging beneath the waves.',\n",
       "   'description': \"A legendary creature of the sea, aspidochelones are eldritch whales of titanic size. When floating near the surface of the water, aspidochelones have frequently been mistaken by desperate sailors for small islands due to the craggy, mottled flesh of their steeply humped backs. Yet, upon tethering their boats to the whale's tough hide and lighting a fire to ward off the cold, many castaways discover to their horror that the spur of land they have beached upon is in fact an enormous creature. This realization comes too late for many unfortunate souls as the creature plunges beneath the waves, dragging trespassers down with it. An aspidochelone appears to be a huge whale with an extraordinarily thick, rock-like hide. From tail to snout, the creature generally measures more than 500 feet in length, and weighs upward of 100,000 tons. Few ever see an aspidochelone for what it actually is, however, having only glimpsed the pitted and uneven skin of its topside. As seabirds and other creatures come to rest upon the hibernating creature, they carry with them plant seeds and dirt. Over time, the accumulated plants and wildlife gives an aspidochelone the appearance of a small, densely inhabited island. Ecology Aspidochelones universally live in the deep ocean, as only such large bodies of water can sustain their enormous appetites. Fortunately for seafaring civilizations that rely upon fishing and sea trade for their livelihoods, the gigantic whales are rarely seen. Thought by many to be creatures of myth, the incredibly long-lived aspidochelones spend most of their adult lives in extended periods of hibernation. The creatures possess sluggish metabolisms, allowing them to remain dormant for decades at a time as they slowly consume the fat built up during previous feeding frenzies. As they float near the surface of the water, drifting with the oceanic currents, the whales are frequently mistaken for small islands. Even while hibernating, aspidochelones exude an intoxicating pheromone, causing birds and animals such as sea lions to seek them out. While the huge numbers of creatures rarely cause the beasts to rouse from their slumber, foolhardy human explorers or would-be settlers often startle them out of their reveries when they mistake the creatures' skin for rock or clay. Even when provoked by humans, aspidochelones seldom remain awake unless stirred by their ferocious hunger. When they waken, the whales are wracked by terrible hunger pangs and rampage about the oceans, seeking tons of prey to consume before sinking into their torpor once again. An aspidochelone is a terror during its feeding season, rightfully feared by seagoing civilizations as a monster of the deep come to devour the world. When feeding, the whales consume vast quantities of food, devouring schools of fish, large sea creatures, and sailing vessels alike. Such immense consumption of sea life frequently devastates local ecosystems, wiping out all food sources for dozens of leagues in every direction. Habitat & Society Aspidochelones do not possess any society to speak of, as they spend most of their time floating aimlessly about the ocean. When two aspidochelones of the opposite gender encounter one another, however, each creature is roused from its hibernation by the other's pheromones. From these unions only one aspidochelone is ever born, and the whales spend 6 months raising the calf to maturity. Once the calf becomes full-grown, the aspidochelones part ways, never to see one another again. Among island cultures, a number of myths have sprung up around the creatures. Legends speak of how an irresistible smell lures sailors to remote islands, only to have the entire ship and crew devoured by the titanic whales in a single gulp. A few outlandish myths even claim that the creatures have devoured entire islands, while pirate tales tell of fantastic treasure buried within the hides of beasts like island. Many of these cultures regard aspidochelones as gods of the sea that call men to their deaths.\"},\n",

       "   'description': \"Towering, rage-wracked brutes enslaved to the will of Hell, chortovs fume upon the borders and ramparts of Hell's hinterlands, murderous deterrents to any who would besiege the shores of the infernal realm or seek to escape. Born from the remains of souls not destined for Hell but damned nonetheless, chortovs carry with them the rage of those who have suffered the multiverse's cruelest injustice, and by the inescapable yoke of diabolical magic find themselves set upon the enemies of their merciless captors. Trapped within grotesque bodies of writhing, porcine flesh and smoldering hellfire, these horrors hate all things-other creatures, their fate, and the lords who have ensnared them and forced them to serve even past damnation. Standing over 20 feet tall, chortovs are mountains of flesh, muscle, and flame. Each weighing upward of 5 tons, these devils bear plates and bands of diabolical armor that serve as physical manifestations of the infernal sorceries that bind them as eternal slaves to Hell. Each chortov's armor is unique, often bearing images of the vaguely remembered torments their constituent souls once suffered. Their bodies, too, bear incongruities uncommon in other diabolical races, harkening toward the lawless natures of the soul-stuff from which these terrors are sculpted. Ecology Not all souls damned to the depths of the Pit deserve their places therein. Trapped planar travelers, goodly souls slain as diabolical sacrifices, or captives who would otherwise face torments elsewhere upon the planes-all might become prisoners of any one of Hell's inescapable layers, eternally condemned to an unfair damnation. Yet Hell cares nothing for the souls that toil and suffer within its depths, all being fodder for the infinite exertions of the infernal machine. As frightened souls suffer over centuries of horror, losing what once existed of their individuality, those rightfully damned to the Pit join with the fundament of that realm, supplying the infernal realm with the terrible sustenance it requires to-over the span of eons-excrete forth mindless lemures. Yet souls not meant for Hell fail to sustain the plane, collecting in mindless spirit cancers of primal pain and blind rage. From these cysts of wrathful, unrighteous damnation, the powers of Hell forge chains in the shape of terrible armor, creating within gigantic, barely restrained beings of hatred and living hellfire, and turn them toward the enemies of the infernal realm. These towering blasphemies are the chortovs. Despite being unwilling servants of devilkind, chortovs are irretrievable prisoners of Hell. As the processes by which the infernal realm torments, destroys, and refines souls into the stuff of fiends last for innumerable centuries, and as untold numbers of the damned comprise a single devil, no remnant of individual lives, ambition, or memory remains within these gigantic terrors. Yet despite a lack of specifics, all chortovs are consumed by an overwhelming understanding that they are slaves to a hated master and the impotent knowledge that, for all their might and wrath, the one thing they can never strike against is their captors. Thus, while other devils stand united as zealots inspired by the will of the archdevils and Asmodeus himself, chortovs serve only because they must, suffering eternally through a second damnation. Habitat & Society Upon their grotesque creations, most chortovs find themselves stationed on the frontiers of Hell, where they possess innate control over the hellfire that flickers along the infernal realm's brazen ramparts. Their mastery over these infernal flames often sees them recruited away from Avernus, drawn to some of the most dismal forges in the Pit, such as the fortress-cities of Dis and the Burning Legions of Phelgethon, where their titanic strength and rage is harnessed to power the foundries. Chortovs rarely work in groups, each arrogant but typically dull-witted brute harboring a vicious hatred for the grotesqueries, ineptitudes, and injustice tormenting others of their kind. Should they be forced into close proximity by the orders of their lords, such devils tolerate one another, but are quick to quarrel with their monstrous cousins. While such conflicts never come to blows-the chortovs restricted by their armor from defying the will of Hell-the distraction typically overshadows any benefit gained by their tandem efforts. As such, chortovs typically work alongside diabolical keepers, devils with the desires of Hell and its lords intrinsic to their beings. These minders typically come from the ranks of lesser devils, specifically ordered to direct the ferocious destructive might of these gigantic fiends. Barbazus, erinyes, and-most commonly-imps typically serve as minders of their towering brethren, as even greater devils fear the might of those rare chortovs that manage to escape Hell's control.\"},\n",

       "   'description': 'Sometimes referred to as \"watchsouls,\" lares are subtle, benevolent spirits that prefer to spend their existence on the Material Plane minding the homes and fortunes of deserving mortals. Kind but aloof, lares watch over their mortal wards and help only when they are most needed. Yet where their homes are intruded upon or their charges imperiled, they prove frighteningly effective guardians, turning everything in their tiny dominions into living weapons. Lares are innately invisible, making the nature of their existence something of a mystery. Originating from the Upper Planes, these spirits have no true bodies and appear only as vague spectral eddies to those capable of seeing invisible beings. Yet while their forms prove vague, their blessings are undeniable. Ecology Although formed upon the Upper Planes, lares find themselves drawn to the Material Plane. While some seek out mortal souls to watch over out of some innate sense of protectiveness, others feel a more specific draw, searching out members of specific races, nations, heritages, or families. Upon taking up residence in a home of their choosing, what motivates and sustains these benevolent spirits is little understood. They seem to take sustenance from positive emotions, growing weak if left in places with quarrelsome residents or that fall to ruin. Lares never seem to die from negative emotions or abandonment, though, merely biding their time in the hopes that their dwelling might someday again host amenable residents. Habitat & Society Mortals sharing their home with a lar often create household shrines to them. These tiny sanctuaries, called lararia (singular lararium), serve to house the lar\\'s statuae. Though the lar does not require offerings, many families give them anyway, treating their spirit with reverence. Over time, the lar might become like a member of the family, with the spirit offering advice and taking a keen interest in the raising of children and protection of the home. Once a family has been chosen, a lar does not leave its dwelling, not even to follow the family during extended leaves. The only exception to this is if the family takes the statua with them, though this is not a practice lares encourage. Since the statuae are their anchors to the Material Plane, lares are insecure about exposing them to the outside world where they might be lost, stolen, or damaged. Summoning a Lar A tradtion said to have been created and passed down since the days of lost Azlant, many families, homes, and even shops and public buildings along the Inner Sea invite lares to take up residence, seeking the blessings of the divine. Few, however, know when their invitations have been accepted, though, as a lar might prove aloof for months or years as it gauges its new wards. In order to welcome such spirits, families construct tiny effigies called statuae in the shapes of honored ancestors, regional heroes, or fanciful creatures, in which the spirits might come and reside. These statuae are non-magical effigies, typically composed of stone or fine wood and anointed with fine lacquers and oils, requiring 2 days, a successful DC 20 Craft check, and 40 gp to create. Once created, these Diminuative figures typically have a hardness of 5 and 10 hit points. If destroyed, a statua may be recreated in this same method. Summoning a lar is a more elaborate affair, requiring nightly prayers and small offerings of fruit, incense, flowers, and similar gifts to the statuae. For each night one prays to the figure for their home or family\\'s protection there is a cumulative 1% chance a lar hears and turns its attention to the petitioner. This attention doesn\\'t mean that a lar will aid a home, but merely that it has heard the prayer, and it might yet decide that its philosophies and virtues are incompatible with the supplicant. If such is the case, the lar quietly ignores the prayer, and the petitioner\\'s chance to gain a lar\\'s attention resets to 0%, all entirely unknown to the mortal. When a lar does accept an invitation, it may immediately plane shift to the associated statua, claiming it as its own. A lar typically makes some subtle acknowledgement that it has come, perhaps slightly altering its statua\\'s appearance or lighting candles upon its arrival. It still often takes months, even years, for a lar to become intimate with a family and make its presence actively known, and some never do. Lares in Golarion Lares exhibit extremely variable personalities, and while some prove aloof even after centuries, others become gregarious members of their protected families. Noted here are just two such dichotomous lares rumored to guard sites in Golarion. Uncle Penates: When only the members of the Aphinius family of Taldor are present, their home\\'s lar possesses the expensive painting within their drawing room. From its hidden statua just behind the painting, the boisterous spirit delights in animating the fine oils to make it appear as though the paunchy and opulently dressed Taldan nobleman pictured is personally relaxing and conversing with the family members nearby. None of the family know the nature of the effect, many believing the house is haunted by the spirit of their ancestor, but none fear or begrudge the presence of kind old Uncle Penates. Wolz: This lar has long lingered in the burnt-out ruin of an old stone cottage just east of Windsong Abby in Varisia. His wolfshaped statua having fallen beneath a pile of hearth stones, Wolz subtly watches over any goodly travelers who come to rest in the tiny ruin, lighting a fire, providing water, and warding off danger as if they were his long-lost family.'},\n",

       "   'description': 'Regal, fearsome, and unfeeling, deimaviggas seek to turn the faithful from their gods, using cold logic to proselytize the path of atheism, the freedom of the mortal spirit, and the order offered by Hell. Their slowly ever-shifting masks speak envenomed words and imply the hollow nature of their lies. Speaking out against all deities-except for Asmodeus, whom they subtly tout as a bringer of discipline even as they downplay his divinity-these deadly intellectuals know that those who turn from their deities are more likely to succumb to the temptations of their diabolical brethren. Rather than attempting to sway the souls of individual mortals, these cunning fiends take on the roles of prophets of reason, disguising themselves beneath layers of illusion to evangelize the virtues and freedoms of lives unshackled from demanding deities. Occasionally one might focus its arguments on a soul of particular piety, delighting in throwing deities\\' most devoted servants into endless crises of faith. Deimaviggas care little for what gods their depredations affect, disenfranchising the worshipers of the divine and the profane alike. In their natural shapes, deimaviggas stand 7 feet tall and weigh a mere 120 pounds. When disguised, though, they typically take the forms of wise old men, priests who have \"realized their folly,\" and even \"angels\" of truth. Habitat & Society Deimaviggas prefer to spend their time upon the Material Plane, swaying the weak and corruptible souls of mortals. There they seek out either vast mortal cities, where their heresy might reach many ears, or small communities where the isolated might fall to their blasphemous philosophizing. When in Hell, though, they linger in Caina, tormenting the souls of those trapped upon its lonely islands, developing and testing complicated and often confusing arguments. Preferring to operate alone, these poison-tongued devils rarely work with others of their kind, even though their status as greater devils affords them great control over their lesser brethren. They find their arguments benefit from simplicity, their endeavors complicated by even the most obedient minions. Pit fiends and infernal dukes sometimes utilize deimaviggas as spies and spreaders of dissension and confusion, though even among devilkind these enigmatic fiends are considered strange and unnerving.'},\n",

Worthless, clublike hands waggle like maggots, directing a cloud of weathered scrolls and blasphemous tomes that orbit its bulk.

       "   'description': \"Bloated scholars of despair, ayngavhauls collect, create, and spread heresies and apocrypha, sowing disbelief and corruption to all who would seek their foul wisdom. Ironically among the most humanlike, yet still most repulsive breeds of devilkind, these corpulent blasphemers are barely even able to move without the aid of their profane floating thrones. Although their bloated forms make them considerably less of a threat than their brethren physically, they speak maledictions foul enough to agonize those who hear them, yet even with such powers of vicious wisdom, their true strength lies in their envenomed words and temptations of the mind. Their centuries of research grant them great leverage over their diabolical kin, and few devils dare not obey the summons of these hellish scholars. Ayngavhauls are roughly ovular in form, their def lated girths about 10 feet tall with their rolls of wet gristle spreading over 13 feet wide. Off their thrones, these devils weigh approximately 2,300 pounds, though the eldest can weigh considerably more. Ecology Ayngavhauls' bloated girths make them slaves to their repulsive physical forms. All ayngavhauls, even the newly formed, are monstrously obese, trapped within prisons of their own leaking, diabolical flesh. To aid them, though, the forges of Phlegethon create terrifying thrones empowered by infernal magics. These foul chariots hold their corpulent masters aloft, serving as both vehicles and sources of profane protection. Each throne of skulls is bound to a specific ayngavhaul, dissolving into a pile of ashes and a breath of searing iron dust should its master be destroyed. Habitat & Society The majority of ayngavhuals frequent the grim libraries of Hell, particularly the mired museums of Stygia; the Fallen Fastness of Dis; and Betzebbul, the palace of Baalzebul, in Cocytus. Within these heretical storehouses and academies of evil, these grotesque devils rewrite the histories of countless worlds to obscure truths and skew the past toward the desires of Hell. Grotesque curators of a sort, individual ayngavhauls take great pride in specializing in fields none of their brethren have ever thought to focus their studies upon-the more obscure and blasphemous, the better. Thus, while one devil might spend eons learning all there is to know of linnorm frost poisons, another might research the nuances of Azlanti voice tearing. Each seeks to promote its particular field of research above all others, sowing its knowledge among their blasphemous works, minions, and summoners who might put such foul wisdom to the most sinister uses. They prove incessantly paranoid that the works of their brethren might be outstripping their own discoveries, or that others in related fields might be stealing their research, thus proving both suspicious of their kindred and intimately familiar with the works of other infernal scholars. As such, a single ayngavhaul might begrudgingly point a summoner in search of specific information toward a diabolical expert, though these knowledge-obsessed fiends never reveal their secrets without demanding a price.\"},\n",

In one clawed gauntlet it grips a long, twisted trident, while in the other it readies a thick net woven with fiendish barbs.',\n",
       "   'description': \"Fearsome giants of steel and blades, levalochs serve within the armies of archdevils and infernal dukes as potent warriors and tenacious hunters, creatures of absolute discipline endlessly obedient to diabolical tyrants. Renowned for their skill on Hell's battlefields, these fearsome soldiers excel in moving swiftly over the broken landscapes that typify the nine layers of the Pit, hunting down intruders and seeking out errant souls wherever they might flee. En masse, the armored clanking of obedient and watchful infantry sound like the workings of great machines as levaloch hosts man Hell's ramparts, from the Iron Fortresses of Avernus to the walls of Ashtart. Levalochs possess consistent forms, each resembling all others of their kind in general shape and size, though each devil's armor proves distinctive. Some claim that the arrangement of a levaloch's spikes, horns, blades, or other iron-shod embellishments might reveal what layer of Hell or infernal noble spawned the devil, though few have the time to ponder such concerns as one of these razor-legged legionaries rages forward. With little variation, levalochs stand just over 10 feet tall and weigh almost exactly 1 ton. Ecology Levalochs blur the line between devil and automaton. While created from the souls of the damned and the profane energies of Hell, these fiends live only to obey their masters and, upon their home plane, seemingly possess little will or ambition beyond such obedience. Requiring no food or rest, a levaloch sentinel might hold its post, completely motionless, for centuries, collecting ages of dust without complaint as it awaits orders that might never come. While intelligent, these devils prove fanatically devoted to the causes of their masters, the archdevils, Asmodeus, and Hell itself, drawing on ingrained wells of discipline and faith to mete out the greater will of their overlords. Levalochs are highly prized throughout the Pit for this discipline, held up as epitomes of diabolical warriors second only to the ferocious cornugons, and pointed to throughout the planes as embodiments of the soldier's ideal. Yet this discipline only persists while levalochs remain under orders from more powerful devils. Left to their own devices, each levaloch fancies itself a tyrant by its own right and relishes the opportunity to promote conf lict and bloodshed through petty mortal angst and grudges. While all devils possess anatomies that perpetually baff le mortal scholars, levalochs prove even more enigmatic, having no internal physiology at all. Being little more than living suits of blasphemous chitin and Hell-forged armor, these fiends lack all weaknesses of even infernal flesh and blood, while retaining all of the potent resistances common to their diabolical kin. A levaloch's sentience seems to linger within its armored shell, remaining until that exoskeleton proves too damaged to contain an animating spirit any longer. Should a levaloch's armor be destroyed, the plates of metal and carapace fall to pieces and quickly corrode, revealing nothing more than the strong scent of pitch within. Despite their unusual anatomy, levalochs are still thinking, even cunning creatures. The fiendish intelligences housed within these ironclad horrors cause some sages to draw frightening parallels between levalochs and the profane soul-bound armors of the infamous undead graveknights. Habitat & Society Commonly found upon the first and sixth layers of Hell and amid the outlying fortresses of Dis, levalochs muster in the service of the Pit's most martial tyrants. Most know only their orders, following their masters' commands to the letter, disregarding all things that fall outside of their purview-at least until such things threaten their masters' holdings or themselves. Intruders within infernal citadels sometimes find themselves unchallenged as they wander vast halls watched over by whole platoons of posted, idle levalochs, only to be attacked unexpectedly upon encountering those specifically commanded to stand sentry. These fiends hold to their orders not out of dull-wittedness, but out of obsessive obedience to the rule of Hell, as proven by their murderous cunning in battle. On the rare occasions levalochs find themselves left to their own devices, the true intellect of these armored terrors becomes apparent. Capable of shocking changes in personality, a levaloch that might not have spoken a word in its entire existence might prove shrewd and subtle when it finds itself upon the Material Plane, stirring old angers, forging Hellish weaponry, even training mortal warriors in a strategic game of warmongering and open campaigning, all encouraging bloodshed in the name of Hell. They despise the weakness of emotion and the changeability of mortal minds. Thus, they delight in testing themselves against mortal flesh, indulging in massacres and encouraging genocides against such weak, worthless creatures whenever their plots might gain even the slightest benefit from such atrocities. Such pride rarely proves the undoing of levalochs, though, as these armored fiends treat every battle as a chance to hone their impressive skills and give foes-regardless of race-no quarter.\"},\n",

       "   'description': \"The mythical watchdogs of Hell, cerberi bear the bodies of terrible, powerful hounds and the essences of fiends. Relied upon by villains and frightful beings as guardians and gaolers, these three-headed canine abominations possess far greater cunning than their flensed, bestial appearances would suggest-a terrible intellect they pour largely into malice and enjoyment of their victims' tormented ends. Cerberi draw upon a legendary pedigree, all reputedly tracing their lineage to a single primordial evil beast said to still guard the foundations of some forsaken, deathly realm. Brethren to hell hounds, cerberi loathe their distant kin, viciously attacking such hellspawn if not kept at heel by a tyrannical master. Such are the cruel devices of Hell, though, that brazen hatred breeds ingenuity and new evils. Thus, within the depths of the infernal realm, amid the indomitable pits and fortresses of Malbolgia, devils work at nightmarish beast pens, forcibly breeding monstrous hybrids. Born in fury and profanity, Malbolgian cerberi rage forth, ferocious three-headed hell hounds the size of bulls and more than willing and capable of slaughtering their loathed Nessian warhound kindred. A typical cerberi stands a broad 4 feet tall and weighs over 200 pounds, while a Malbolgian cerberi can reach over 6 feet in height and weigh upward of 400 pounds. Ecology Denizens of Hell, cerberi embody the ferocity and covetousness of that realm. Bent to service as watch beasts or guardians at the gates of the Pit, cerberi possess unique abilities predisposing them to such grim service. Bearing some measure of mastery over souls and their fundamental ability to shift between planes, these infernal hounds easily trap their victims, preventing them from escaping to the safety of more favorable realms. This ability allows the beasts to prey upon both spirits and the denizens of the outer planes, which every so often attempt to leap between realms to avoid danger. Physically, cerberi appear akin to mortal canines, though in truth they hold little in common. As natives of Hell, they resemble devils more than the wolves and hounds of the Material Plane, their fleshless figures and three monstrous heads making this obvious at anything less than extreme distances. Despite the differences in physiology between mortal beasts and these keen hunters of souls, cerberi frequently find themselves treated like unthinking animals-largely due to their inability to speak. Such a mistake often proves deadly, as cerberi possess alert minds and genuine cunning. While most willingly accept the commands of more powerful masters and gory compensations for their efforts, cerberi are intelligent enough to know when they've been slighted and viciously turn on creatures who mistakenly think themselves their masters. Habitat & Society In their natural infernal environments, cerberi might be found anywhere powerful fiends have need for guardians. This makes them frequent fixtures among the dark vaults of Erebus, the estates of Dis, and the fortresses of Avernus. Capable trackers, especially adept at detecting the scent of wayward souls, cerberi also might be found among the legions of the first layer of Hell hunting the freshly arrived damned alongside other devils. Yet, beyond all other tasks, these three-headed hounds excel as captors and minders of the dead, assuring that none of Hell's charges escape their eternal fates. Cerberi's incredible ability to trap victims on planes and track the dead make them highly coveted servants across the multiverse. The live markets of Dis teem with cerberi for sale, both ravenous pups and tested hunters. Daemons and night hags especially covet cerberi and pay high prices for whole packs of the soul-hunting hounds. The hounds' bestial appearances and love of slaughter often cause those who consider themselves cerberi owners to forget the deviousness of their allies, a development that often ends poorly, if not bloodily, for the unwary and the weak. Outside of the devil-tamed reaches of Hell and other foul extraplanar wildernesses, small groups of cerberi gather in harsh, pack-like communities. Typically dominated by the strongest or wiliest member, such packs form swift and deadly tides, stalking trespassers upon their vast hunting grounds and doggedly pursuing any scent of lost souls. Although cerberi gain no sustenance from attacking the dead, as befits their infernal nature, all gain a vicious satisfaction at the feeling of an immortal essence discorporating forever within their deadly jaws.\"},\n",

       "   'description': 'The tools devils use to ensnare the minds and ultimately the souls of their victims vary incredibly, from the most blatant of infernal corruptions to enticements that seem not like temptations at all. The elusive cabal devils, or uniilas as they are known by diabolists, employ one of the most seductive drugs in existence in their snares: magic. Mistresses of the arcane with an understanding of the cultic arts-both arcane and divine-that rivals even that of many greater fiends, these mysterious and aloof sages haunt the most ancient ruins and moldering depths of Stygia, the fifth layer of Hell, researching arcana and puzzling over formulae destined to shake the cosmos. When conjured forth or left to their own devices upon the Material Plane, uniilas make no untoward offers or forceful demands of their mortal hosts; they merely offer greater magical power in any of the various ways they might do so. Should the ease with which such might is granted pollute a mortal\\'s ambitions or lead him to rely upon a devil for his power, such ultimately proves the student\\'s fault, not the eager teacher\\'s. So too does the resulting damnation at the end of the mortal\\'s short life prove more of his own doing than any overt diabolical trap, making uniilas\\' methods all the more sinister for their subtlety. Summoning Cabal Devils Uniilas eagerly seek passage to the Material Plane and as such welcome summons by mortal casters. Whether to experiment with spells, seek out new magic, or corrupt mortals with their knowledge, what plots an uniila holds often prove inscrutable and of secondary interest to a summoner. Tempering their desire to reach the mortal plane, an uniila\\'s vanity prevents it from serving a witless or hopeless summoner. Thus, uniilas turn the act of summoning about on those who call upon them via a planar binding spell, requesting that such mortals demonstrate their spellcasting prowess. If the mortal effectively casts a spell the uniila does not know (not one of those spells she possesses as a sorcerer spell or spell-like ability), or performs a spell of 5th-level or higher, the caster gains a +2 bonus on the opposed Charisma check made to bind the devil. Occasionally, an uniila purposefully remains to serve an inferior spellcaster, or one that fails his opposed Charisma check. Granting the inept tools they should never possess amuses the devils, and even the most incompetent \"masters\" might prove useful in seeking out components of an uniila\\'s ongoing projects in Hell.'},\n",

A polished bronze breastplate, greaves, and helmet dutifully remain to protect this felled warrior, while its naked, skeletal hands still clutch a short spear and a round bronze shield. Yet, beneath its decrepit armor and moldering bones, a deftness and deadly intent linger on, embodied in a hellish light smoldering in its shadowed eye sockets.',\n",
       "   'description': 'Raised from the corpses of famed warriors and legendary legionaries, spartoi (singular \"spartolos\") walk again, dragged from death to do battle once more. Greater than mere unthinking corpses, like skeletal champions spartoi carry with them some vestige of their past lives and experiences. Yet what sets them apart from lesser undead are their retained caginess and knowledge of tactics, allowing them to function with deadly efficiency in troops of their brethren. Sometimes called the \"sown men,\" spartoi hold a fundamental connection to the near-mythical magical items known as a spartoi seeds, teeth that when planted in the earth summon forth these undead, fully armed and ready for command. Although ancient versions of these items prove especially rare, the well-known nature of their myth has led to dozens of modern versions being created and, with them, a rise in the appearance of spartoi. A typical spartolos stands about 5-1/2 to 6-1/2 feet tall, weighing approximately 70 pounds with its full compliment of equipment. Ecology As undead beings, spartoi have no need for food or shelter and have little effect on their environments. Yet despite being obedient undead, all spartoi seem to favor resting as disjoined piles of bones rather than standing corpses. Although the undead know no sensations of exertion, spartoi left to their own devices or without commands to do otherwise collapse into scattered remains. Whether such is a matter of tactics and subterfuge or fulfills some other need, the animate corpses give no hint. Spartoi detect as being of evil alignment merely because the powers animating them prove fundamentally foul. In some cases, spartoi raised from the corpses of particularly goodly or otherwise forceful individuals might retain the alignment they possessed in life. Habitat & Society The spartoi are undead skeletons-albeit much more powerful than other versions-designed for war. They have no wants or desires other than to serve their masters, and they carry no fear. Though they have some defense against channeled energy, the spartoi are just as susceptible to divine spellcasters as any other undead. All spartoi spring into being with weaponry, typically a spear, buckler, and breastplate, though some rare individuals have been known to arise with more unusual armaments. In such cases, short swords, punching daggers, glaives, and great clubs prove most common. Only the rarest of spartoi have been known to arise brandishing ranged weapons, their undead forms seeming to lack the coordination for such arms. In any case, spartoi weaponry and armor typically bear the markings of ancient cultures, often appearing to be from lands near where the undead (or its spartoi seeds) were created. Despite their skill and cooperation in battle, spartoi have little interest in one another. Even spartoi apparently risen from rival nations or cultures seem to forget all past rivalries in death. The mind of a spartolos is a mind possessed by a will to do battle and a skill or instinct seemingly inherent in the bones of great warriors, actual vestiges of personality lingering on only in the rarest cases. Even those spartoi retaining some hint of their former personalities seem interested only in completing their master\\'s will and swiftly returning to their rightful place in death. Such causes many concerned with the necromantic arts to ponder over whether their magic draws forth an actual spirit to its bones, or merely causes a corpse to act with a hint of the personality that was bound to it in life. Creating a Spartolos A spartolos might be created in a number of ways. Most simply, a create undead spell cast by a magic-user of caster level 16 or greater can infuse a dead body with a heroic spirit, resurrecting it as a spartolos. Alternatively, one might seek out rare items known as spartoi seeds. Although relatively rare, the oldest seeds might summon forth the corpses of legendary heroes rather than typical spartoi. These slain champions, while possessing the same statistics as normal spartoi in death, possess the ability to speak and often bear great insight into the ways of battle or memories from their lives. Mythic Seeds Numerous myths across Golarion tell of legendary, magical fangs that summon forth the spirits or corpses of powerful warriors. The most pervasive of these tales comes from the ancient myth of the Jiskan hero Strada, though countless variations exist in dozen of cultures across Avistan. Legends tell of the mythic hero Strada tasked by the devil Alichino with the impossible charge of besieging an unconquerable city. Seeking out the oracle of Gorum, god of battle, the hero was gifted the thousand fangs of the dragon Kathalphas, who was said to have grown an additional tooth with every champion she had slain. Told to sow these fangs into the dust surrounding the city, the hero praised Gorum and departed graciously. Upon reaching the city, he did as the priest had advised, and to his astonishment, the skeletons of the dragon\\'s thousand victims leapt from the ground, clad in all the finery of epic warriors, and arrayed to do battle in Strada\\'s name. The unconquerable city fell in an hour, much to the fury of capering Alichino, and for 90 splendorous years Strada ruled as king with an army of the world\\'s greatest warriors ever guarding his palace gates.

       "   'description': \"An infernal paradox at once wondrous and terrifying, tempting and blasphemous, the entity called the Son of Suns, Prince of Paradises, Jadros Voax, Baphon, Vexsoul, or simply Basileus serves as the herald of Asmodeus and harbinger of Hell's will. Few who have faced the messenger of the Archfiend survive the experience unchanged, for he is the very word of Hell. Typically appearing as a youth of stunning beauty and of the same race as those who look upon him-even when appearing before those of multiple races-little in the herald's comely appearance, finery, or proud bearing sets him apart from the vainglorious princes of countless mortal nations. In his radiant eyes, though, dance hellfire flames and a hint of the power he bears himself and often offers. To encounter Basileus is to know the interest or ire of the lord of Hell himself. Like his master, the herald knows no love for mortalkind, striving only to fulfill the worlds-spanning master schemes of the Prince of Darkness and draw souls into the grip of Hell by the legion. As such, he most often serves as an envoy between Asmodeus and other deities and extraplanar figures of note, rarely deigning to set foot upon the raucous and uncouth Material Plane. When his master's will dictates he travel to the mortal realm, though, his words bear all the weight of Hell, and typically offer temptations few souls can hope to refuse. Occasionally his master bids him answer the summons of the few mortals who hold the Prince of Darkness's favor, but even these forays typically prove subtle steps toward some greater infernal goal. In his humanoid form, Basileus appears as a 6-foottall mortal of surprising but unnatural beauty, with a languid voice like warm wine over silk. Although typically of male gender, this is not always the case, though he always appears before his lord in masculine form. Much of his form is an illusion, though, and a highly subjective illusion at that. Those who can see past Basileus's shrouds of innate deception find a human-like figure resembling the idealized form he presents, though still appearing somehow hollow. The most daring and ancient fiends have suggested that Basileus bears a resemblance to Baalzebul before Asmodeus punished the archdevil by stripping him of his angelic appearance-a rumor that leads the lord of the seventh to loathe his master's herald even more than he despises most creatures. A Thousand Terrors Through the millennia, dozens of immortal beings have served as heralds of the Prince of Darkness-even Baalzebul holding this position for a time before his cursed advancement to archdevil. Yet without fail, each herald has eventually overstepped his bounds and garnered Asmodeus's disfavor, facing a quiet, ignominious, and likely torturous end within Nesus's depths. Yet even after his past heralds' march of disappointments, Asmodeus holds Basileus as the most perfect of all his emissaries, for rather than elevating the messenger from among the ranks of his diabolical legions, the lord of Hell personally crafted his servant to meet his every expectation. An infernal automaton of sorts, Hell's herald is a being zealously devoted to the Prince of Darkness, even beyond the allegiances of devilkind, archdevils, or the Pit itself. Many among Hell's infernal hierarchy have whispered of their lord's herald's true nature, suggesting that he is a terrible amalgam, drawn from the painwracked nightmares of the Archfiend's past emissaries; a being shaped from the deepest proto-stuff of Hell itself; or even a vaporous being distilled from a measure of Hell's collective suffering. Regardless, the ever-changing physical nature of Asmodeus's herald and his unwavering loyalty to his master are widely known throughout the planes and beyond. On the Material Plane, Basileus has become a legend in his own right. Although rarely visiting the worlds of the mortal realm, wherever he treads he takes the form of the greatest terror of the age. Such leads to highly varied reports of the herald's form and nature, even among Asmodeus's worshipers, and the confusion and apprehension seem to please both Basileus and his master greatly. Among the Prince of Darkness's enemies, Basileus is a thousand horrors known by a thousand names. Tales of his appearance across Golarion have granted him a dozen terrible names: the Bleeding Oliphaunt, Baphon Reborn, and the Seventh Spawn being among those most often heard in fearful whispers. Each of these titles and countless more have been recorded by scholars of the divine outside the church of Asmodeus, with such disparities, though inaccurate, still capturing the deceit inherent in the herald's form and a measure of the horror that is Basileus.\"},\n",

       "   'description': \"Violent xenophobes, the creatures typically called nihilois, devashades, or shadow lords pose a rising threat to interlopers into their umbral realm. In ages immemorial, these creatures enjoyed vast empires upon the mysterious Plane of Shadow, but through the millennia incursion by immigrants and interlopers have eroded their way of life and scattered their numbers. In the face of spellcasters from the Material Plane striding across their homeland-using it as little more than a umbral thoroughfare-and whole terrible races like kytons migrating to their native reaches, the nihilois have long retreated into the deepest darknesses of their realm. Yet as alien encroachment continues, slowly the nihilois have revealed themselves, and found to their surprise that they are powerful and feared. Nihilois-as the first travelers from Golarion termed them, believing them to be members of an ancient mythical race-resemble gaunt, vaguely humanoid creatures shrouded in ever-writhing shadow stuff with fountains of dark tendrils jutting from their backs. They often hold these thin limbs in tight bunches that appear like strange, dense wings, but unfurl them easily and with shocking speed to lash out against their enemies. Unable to vocalize words, nihilois are widely distrusted by creatures foreign to the Plane of Shadow. Even a pair of the shadowy natives is unsettling to those encountering them for the first time as they silently gesture and nod, holding secret councils few others can understand. Creatures frequently interacting with them know the nihilois have a shared name for their race, though since these creatures speak only telepathically, the term sounds more like the passage of massive wings than a word pronounceable in most sentient tongues. Ecology Artisans of the Plane of Shadow, with a near-peerless understanding of that realm, nihilois can, like sculptors, twist and manipulate the very fabric of their home plane. Birthed from the dark plane, these natives are as true inhabitants of their realms as the denizens of the Material Plane are of theirs. The ever-changing gloom of the plane permeates these creatures, and they likewise prove dark and changeable. Yet as the nature of shadow is to flee from the light, so too do nihilois find it natural to retreat from interlopers into their realm. Having done so since times unrecorded, only in recent centuries has a new sentiment grown among these shadow lords, a feeling that they are losing an important battle and that both their survival and their realm are threatened. Thus, slowly over the span of centuries, resistance to foreign invaders has gradually become a hallmark of this mysterious race. Nihilois, both male and female, stand nearly 7 feet tall, but often raise themselves up off the ground on coils of their dark tendrils. Those thick bunches of thin limbs that extend from their backs they typically hold together in dense clusters, causing them to appear like wings, but can unravel them and bring them to bear with incredible swiftness. Having a highly malleable form, nihilois are light, weighing an average of 65 pounds. When angered, they can temporarily inflate themselves to appear larger, whipping their tendrils around in a fierce display. In addition to serving as weapons and locomotion, nihiloi tentacles are used to feed as well. When tightly wrapped around or within a meal, the tendrils secrete a digestive acid and absorb nutrients through tiny openings. Habitat & Society Nihilois prove exceedingly rare, most having retreated to the farthest-flung depths of the Plane of Shadow where their numbers have dwindled. With rising frequency, though, many have shrugged off their race's fear of interlopers and come to lurk in the shadow reflections of cities on the Material Plane. In such eerie metropolises, groups of nihilois form tightly knit cells, with small groups potentially claiming districts as their own or splitting entire shadow cities between themselves. Quick to influence and master lesser shadow creatures-such as shadows, shadow garms, and fetchlings-nihilois can draw surprisingly large populations of shadow creatures to a single location. While large clusters of such beings don't overtly threaten the Material Plane, such is true only so long as the natives of that plane stay within their realm. Those spellcasters who step from their city homes onto the Plane of Shadow might find the land far less deserted than is typical for the plane, a realm of living shadow and hostile, glowing eyes. Outside such cities or group settings, lone nihilois hunt down interlopers into their realm, shadowing trespassers until the time is right to strike. While slaying such intruders satisfies their need for vengeance, all nihilois also seek out portals leading onto the Plane of Shadow and destroy such passages however they can, striving toward a day when all know to avoid the nighted realm.\"},\n",

       "   'appearance': 'Slinking forth on bent limbs and gnarled claws, this twisted abomination bears a resemblance to a starved, plague-ridden ape, its form bestial and bent, with pallid skin stretched unnaturally over knotted bone. Yet its visage holds a greater terror, for amid fangs and milky eyes linger the withered features of a living corpse.',\n",
       "   'description': 'A restless and savage form of undead, the vrykolakas knows only rage and relishes the suffering of those who failed it in life. Reanimated corpses of wicked and vengeful souls denied even the basic burial rites, these unreasoning vampire-kin unleash their wrath against the living, indiscriminately spreading disease and death among all in their paths. Their bitterness at their own disgraced ends drives them to a loathing of all life and a jealous desire to see all other living creatures fall to their same level of profanity and debasement. Such hardly proves a conscious plot, though, but rather a fundamental instinct. Thus, a single vrykolakas can devastate an entire village, potentially spawning a host of new vrykolakas from their victims. A vrykolakas (the name both singular and plural) appears as a terrible, bestial corruption of the being it was in life. Twisted by rage and undeath into an animalistic shape, these undead bear the taint of death, their bodies lean to the appearance of starvation and pocked with evidence of rot and disease. Hunched and twisted, a vrykolakas\\'s bent spine is the same length it was in life if straightened, but the feral posture of most cause them to slump to a mere 4-1/2 to 5 feet tall. The wasting of death also greatly decreases the corpse\\'s weight, reducing even hearty men to at least 20 or 30 pounds less than they weighed in life. Ecology Despite its savage and decayed appearance, a vrykolakas often passes through towns and villages undeterred, due to its supernatural ability to disguise itself. With the ability to cloak its terrible shape, a vrykolakas typically appears little different than it did in life. Death removes much of the living corpse\\'s sense of who it was, though, so vrykolakas rarely reconstruct their original appearances with complete accuracy. Thus, family and acquaintances often notice the resemblance, but do not readily identify a vrykolakas as the resurrected individual. A vrykolakas thrives upon disease and death, drawing its vigor from those humanoids it passes near. It walks among the living merely to infect them with its grave taint, passing on the subtle corruption of death. Its mere touch drains the life from a victim as well, stealing from its very essence. A vrykolakas\\'s favored victims typically come from among its former family members and friends, which it pursues with only half a memory of any previous connection, yet a lingering malice, as such former companions failed to prevent its accursed fate. A vrykolakas is uniquely bound to the place where it died or its body was originally interred. It must return to this site every Starday and bury itself amid the earth or stones to rest for 24 hours. A vrykolakas is entirely helpless during this period and can be easily destroyed if it can be located. The vampire-kin understand this weakness, though, and go to great lengths to avoid being followed to their resting places. Habitat & Society Vrykolakas typically appear near or in rural areas close to their graves. They walk the open streets of villages and hamlets during daylight hours, avoiding direct interaction and attention, all the while infecting those nearby and robbing them of their vitality. By night they seek to take their revenge more overtly, wreaking havoc upon the community, destroying food and property, attacking and smothering people in their beds, stealing valuables, and generally terrorizing people. Many rural superstitions and prejudices against strangers stem from tales of vrykolakas, slipping quietly into town or lurking at the edges of a community, spreading death and despair among the innocent. The Greek Vampire The vrykolakas (pronounced \"vree-KO-la-kahss\") is an undead creature from Greek folklore. Synonymous with revenants, these terrors manifest as humans that have returned from the grave to perform some act before they can peacefully rest. Many stories of the vrykolakas are not of horrid, evil undead, but of deceased persons attempting to return to their former lives, such as the shoemaker who returned from the grave to mend his children\\'s shoes, carry water, and chop firewood. The more vengeful type of vrykolakas gained stronger belief in Greece after the arrival of Slavic immigrants, who brought with them tales of blood-drinking vampires and werewolves. The word vrykolakas itself borrows from Slavic, derived from the Bulgarian word vukodlak, vuk meaning \"wolf \" and dlaka meaning \"fur.\" This suggests that vrykolakas were somehow associated with werewolves, most likely due to the Slavic belief that werewolves became vampires after they died. A person could become a vrykolakas in a variety of ways. The most common involve a person being evil and immoral, an excommunication from the church, or improper burial rites. Some thought that eating the meat of a sheep that had been killed or wounded by a wolf or a werewolf would turn a person into a vrykolakas. A cat or other animal jumping over a dead body could also result in its evil return. Curses, such as \"may the ground not receive thee,\" would also condemn the recipient to undeath as a vrykolakas. Many also believed that a vrykolakas would knock at your door and call your name, but could only do so once. If one answered the door, he would die shortly thereafter, and become a vrykolakas. For this reason, the superstition that one should not answer the door until the second knock still exists in some Greek villages.'},\n",

With a bellowing roar, the creature shakes its massive head in challenge, then paws the ground and charges.',\n",
       "   'description': \"Ravener behemoths walk the land as the ultimate consumers of all things. This includes every manner of beast, plant, and mineral caught in their path. They indiscriminately fill their five ever-hungry stomachs by cutting wide swaths through tangled jungles, digging through mountains for precious ores, and razing settlements and strongholds to get at those sheltering inside. Sometimes they even ply shallow coastal waters, capsizing ships to feast upon their crews and any other predators drawn by the smell of blood in the water. Monstrously massive, a ravener behemoth stands nearly 60 feet tall on four thick, trunk-like legs and measures up to 80 feet long. Multiple horns and tusks sprout from its face and head, helping it root through even the hardest soil and rocks in search of food. It quickly reduces anything stronger into rubble with its earth-shattering roar and stomping feet. A rocky hide grown from the many minerals it routinely consumes protects it from harm even as lichen, small plants, and trees take root along its back, out of reach of its ravenous mouth. Divine blessings bequeathed by the gods ensure only the most powerful spells or adamantine weapons can lay a behemoth low. As a result, the ravener behemoth fears nothing and eats everything. Ecology Behemoths have existed since the birth of the First World, where they served the gods as work beasts, intelligently shaping and transforming the land to a divine plan. However, when such work ended, some gods sought to put down their creations, hunting them to near-extinction. Others simply forgot them or left them to die as the First World faded away. But many behemoths stubbornly refused to abandon their life's purpose and crossed into the greater world, migrating in an effort to stay close to their creators. Unfortunately, as part of the journey, or because they lost the divine sponsorship of the gods, many behemoths devolved, losing their sentience and becoming nothing more than monstrous animals and creatures of legend. The ravener behemoth exists as one such example. Driven mad by the inattention of the gods and filled with anger over their abandonment, the raveners found a new purpose. Desperately hungry, these multi-stomached behemoths wholly devoted themselves to feasting upon the bounty of all the gods had created, gorging themselves in an effort to fill the void left by their masters and attract the gods' attention once again. Unfortunately, because of their lowered intelligence, most raveners can no longer answer when such attention finally comes, lacking the will or ability to communicate with their creators, and consumed by an all-encompassing hunger instead. The gods mostly leave such behemoths alone, ashamed and reluctant to fully extinguish their enduring spirits. More often, the gods challenge their mortal champions by directing them to deal with such creatures in their stead. Habitat & Society Most ravener behemoths live solitary lives, as their insatiable appetites cause too much strain on a single ecosystem to support more of their kind. Inevitably, when their paths do cross, two possible outcomes emerge. The beasts either do battle to establish dominance over one another, or every 50 years, certain hormones in female raveners can invoke a natural mating instinct between the behemoths instead. A pregnant ravener may produce up to 1d3 offspring per mating cycle, but it then drives off its mate to ensure enough food remains in the area to raise each cub to young adulthood. Raveners may live up to 1,000 years while food sources remain, and frequently migrate when famine strikes. Behemoths of Legend Some ancient raveners retain a measure of their original sentience, occasionally renewing their relationships with the gods to serve as avatars or guardians. Others choose to remain aloof, pursuing their own goals independent of those who created them. These more potent behemoths sustain themselves through divine rituals learned when they served the gods and passed down from one generation to the next. They use their spell-like abilities to enhance the land and better support their enormous appetites. To replicate these more intelligent and independent raveners, add the following abilities to the standard behemoth. A ravener with these abilities is CR 19 and has Int 14, Wis 18, and Cha 18. It speaks Celestial, Sylvan, and Terran. Spell-Like Abilities (CL 15th): Always active-nondetection; At will-create water, detect animals or plants, purify food and drink, soften earth and stone; 3/day-cure critical wounds, heroes' feast, move earth, plant growth; 1/day-find the path, restoration\"},\n",

       "   'description': 'False gods, fallen demagogues, nemesis devils-the fiends known collectively as advodazas survive from dark ages past, when mortals offered worship to base things and unwholesome spirits masqueraded as baleful gods. Although time and faith have turned against these beings, the most tenacious of their kind have refused to fade into oblivion, and to these obstinate corruptors and one-time deities the gates of Hell swing wide and welcoming. These lords of cults and masters of forgotten mysteries find renewed vigor in the depths of the Pit, and those seeking to renew their power and lordship over mortalkind undergo terrible indoctrinations and binding rites that transform them over the ages into true devils. What emerge are eidolons of half-remembered demigods, fallen princes seeking to claim their subjects anew, devils of faith, and fiends of blasphemy-the idol-clad advodazas. No two advodazas look exactly alike, each embodying the powers and concerns that saw it worshiped in ages past and subsequently anthropomorphized as a monstrous being. Typically, this results in quadrupedal, half-bestial shapes bristling with terrible wings, hooves, claws, and fangs. Universally, though, they bear the broken remnants of their fallen faith, usually in the form of cracked idols worn like armor, profane talismans crafted into jewelry, or fearful totems wielded like massive weapons. Despite their range of appearances, all advodazas possess the same core abilities, though some particularly ancient or powerful fiends possess unique abilities. Most advodazas stand 18 feet tall and weigh nearly 9 tons. Ecology Fantastically old beings, advodazas rose from spirits worshiped by mortals in distant ages. While humanoids still huddled in crude shelters, begging any power that would listen for protection from storms, beasts, enemies, hunger, and countless other fears, the spirits of the land, sky, and animals were the first to give heed. Not deities, but elusive influences, these forces heard these early prayers and worked what appeared to be miracles in return for sacrifices and adoration. Slowly, these formless vestiges took shape as idols, fetishes, palladiums, and all manner of cult images. Yet, as knowledge of true deities and the powers they offered worshipers spread, the old spirits were forgotten or demonized and rooted out. While most simply faded into the ethers of time, the bitterest demi-deities of countless worlds found their way to Hell and Asmodeus, who welcomed them and offered them a chance for renewed power and worship, as well as a chance to avenge themselves against the deities and mortals who had snubbed them. Honing their hatreds through ages of flame, these beings emerged from the Pit as advodazas. One of the few breeds of devilkind not forged wholly by Hell itself, advodazas prove exceedingly rare compared to other fiends. Habitat & Society All advodazas seek to return to the Material Plane, where they might tempt new followers to serve, sacrifice, and raise idols to their names. While merciless, advodazas appeal to many mortal servants due to the directness of their interaction and their willingness to grant power or violently smite enemies for a seemingly paltry price. In death, however, their servants find no divine realm nor glory seated beside some grand deity. For when they die, there is only Hell.'},\n",

Carved from a single block of stone or other sturdy material, these constructs resemble towering statues, crafted to appear as servants of specific deities and often etched with icons sacred to their worship. In addition to its fearful body, an ebon acolytus is typically crafted with a companion altar, upon which it might aid its master or an unholy congregation in dark rites and ritual bloodletting. The exact height and weight of an ebon acolytus varies, largely depending on the shape of its body and the quality of the stone used in its creation, though most rise to around 14 feet tall and weigh around 2,500 pounds. Some carry Large sacrificial weapons other than daggers, but these prove rare and vary between faiths. Ecology As artificial creations, ebon acolyti have no bodily needs or functions.

In some rare instances, especially old and well-used ebon acolyti have been known to defy their creators, but only when such masters have defied the will or tenets of their deity. Religious figures claim such rarities are not a sign of devotion from the constructs themselves, though, but instead a manifestation of a deities\\' will operating through a convenient medium. Habitat & Society Altar golems are typically found in places of dark worship, from the expected locations like depraved dungeons and temples consecrated in the name of sinister gods to hidden shrines under the homes of supposedly reputable neighbors or secret mountain hollows. Wherever the perverse will of foul deities takes root, there ebon acolyti might be found. An ebon acolytus\\'s most feared ability is its power to sacrifice living creatures to the dark entity to whom it is devoted. This foul capability rises from a series of profane rites conducted as part of the construct\\'s creation, during which it is bound to a specific patron. A ebon acolytus cannot be reconsecrated to a different deity, and those it sacrifices always appear in the same extraplanar realm. The being an ebon acolytus is created to serve must be of at least deity-level power, and all attempts to create servants that direct souls to a lesser or more vague source fail. Thus, ebon acolyti are typically found dedicated to evil gods, demon lords, archdevils, one of the four horsemen, or similar beings. Those killed by an ebon acolytus prove exceedingly diffcult to recover, except by the power of those devoted to the deity to whom the victim was sacrificed. As such, foul priests often employ ebon acolyti to gain bargaining chips, having their construct minion sacrifice a being and demanding some service should the victim\\'s loved ones wish him returned. Alternately, worshipers of notorious deities often face worldly retribution, but might escape tenacious pursuers by sacrificing themselves to their deity, their sacrificial deaths allowing them to forever elude the magic and vengeance of their foes. Occasionally, there are those who seek to track down and reclaim souls wrongfully slain by ebon acolyti. Many quests to unholy realms have been undertaken in the attempt to rescue such damned souls, though few meet with any success. Although most discussion of ebon acolyti connects them with foul deities, such need not be the case. Tools first and foremost, these constructs might serve non-evil gods, though in most cases their murderous aptitudes are ill suited to such worship. In some cases, particularly in the instances of exotic and little-known deities who prove both benevolent and bloodthirsty, ebon acolyti might be found in the service of goodly faiths, though such instances are exceedingly rare. Construction An ebon acolytus is chiseled from a single block of dark stone, often black granite or marble, jade, or some other lustrous material, and weighing at least 4,000 pounds. The stone must be of exceptional quality and costs at least 6,000 gp. Ebon Acolytus CL 11th; Price 24,000 gp CONSTRUCTION Requirements Craft Construct, animate objects, desecrate, trap the soul, creator must be caster level 11th; Skill Craft (sculpting) or Craft (stonemasonry) DC 16; Cost 12,000 gp Ebon Acolyti on Golarion Though rare, ebon acolyti have been found throughout Golarion, consecrated to a host of foul patrons. While many watch over temples and holy sites of Rovagug, Lamashtu, and Asmodeus-and peripheral shines to his archdevils-they are more commonly found in squalid holes where demon and daemon worshipers enact their blasphemous ceremonies. Below are two particularly infamous ebon acolyti. The Altar of Angazhan: Deep in the Mwangi Expanse lies an ebon acolytus dedicated to the demon lord Angazhan, the Ravener King and Lord of Apes. Carved from obsidian, the altar resembles Angazhan himself, a brutish ape with savage tusks and six long, slender fingers. Unlike other altar golems, the Altar of Angazhan speaks through the Voice of Angazhan, the animated and endlessly furious skull of a massive gorilla that serves as the construct\\'s head. Although the skull possesses only the intellect of an average ape, it \"leads\" a pack of charau-ka that worships it as their god. The tribe\\'s shamans interpret their lord\\'s will in his endless grunts and howls, directing their people to scour the Expanse for food, riches, and sacrificial victims. The Midnight Temple of Egorian: Found in Cheliax\\'s infernal capital, this massive, marble-carved ebon acolytus is known as the Black Altar. Shaped into the likeness of a humanoid devil with sweeping horns and monstrous wings, the Black Altar seems to be carved straight from the layers of Hell itself. At the stroke of midnight on the first day of every ninth week, nine slaves are sacrificed here to the God Fiend, the Black Altar absorbing their blood and sending their souls screaming to Asmodeus. When the altar prepares to kill its victims, its great wings close so none can see the final blow, and when they open again, nothing of the sacrifice remains.'},\n",

       "   'description': 'The giants of the Pit, Hell gigas roam the hinterlands of Hell, stalking forth from ruined, millennia-old fortresses to enslave those who slip through the grasp of devilkind. Called \"phyriphlegeians\" by titans and some of the other elder races of the multiverse, these arrogant and most ancient of giants care only for their own tyrannies, petty schemes made abominable by their masters\\' scale, strength, and disregard for the survival of all other beings. More than capable of personally ruining most of their own foes physically, Hell gigas prefer campaigns of fear and pain, expending legions of slaves before bringing their own monstrous might to bear upon thoroughly defeated foes-though their rage often provokes them to forgo more satisfying climaxes in favor of immediate destruction. The typical Hell gigas stands well over 50 feet tall and weighs upward of 20 tons, in addition to the weight of its armor of bone and metal. Ecology Exceptionally rare creatures, even on their native plane and compared to others of the waning gigas races, Hell gigas bear the crushing weight of beings that have endured millennia of life in Hell. Most appear as wasted giants bearing the scars of countless skirmishes and hardships, many armored over in half-living suits of exposed muscle, knotty bone, and grisly iron. Even with such second skins, the gigas radiate auras of infernal heat, which, along with their incredible strength, allow them to sculpt stone and iron into grim structures and vicious weapons. Habitat & Society Most Hell gigas live on the infernal layers of Avernus, Dis (beyond the city), and Phlegethon, keeping to the mountains and masterless expanses beyond the interests of devils and the damned. In some such realms lie the rare, crumbled ruins of fortresses even larger than the gigas\\' power to craft. Within these ruins and the lavasoaked catacombs below, the Hell gigas make their homes, living as despots apart from others of their kind, ruling over stray fiends, hellspawn, and wayward souls. Few Hell gigas care to venture forth from the infernal realm, finding other planes uncomfortably cold. When they do, they universally hold a special hatred for fire giants, loathing the giants yet at the same time delighting in enslaving them and forcing them to do their will. Hell gigas attempt to avoid devils as much as possible. While a gigas can easily crush most devils, those who slight greater devils or members of the diabolical nobility risk destruction or enslavement by the easily offended lords of Hell. The First Giants Scholars of the unfathomable eons that mark the immortal tides of extraplanar history have long debated by what means the inhabitants of the Material Plane took their varied-yet in many ways similar-forms. Many adhere to the assumption that creator deities designed each mortal race, creating what they deemed as right or desirable in miniature multitudes. Others, however, claim it began with the titans. Mighty beings, not unlike gods themselves in many ways, titans possess power beyond most races and a history stretching back before even the oldest mortal races. Although the titan race has diminished, now inhabiting only the most remote corners of Elysium and the Thanatotic realms of the Abyss, their forms have persisted throughout the millennia, and their ancient progeny and myriad inheritors now range where titans once ruled. After ages of life upon the disparate planes of existence, the true titans gave rise to scions imbued with the powers of those strange realms, beings known as gigas, which were less than their progenitors but still mighty beyond reason. Distinctive to each realm the titans trod, the gigas rose as servants and emissaries of their lords and ancestors, carving out dominions among the natives of the planes that so shaped them. As countless ages passed and gates opened, allowing passage to the Material Plane, both titans and gigas found their way to new realms. While most titans cared little for these small, mundane worlds, the gigas found places where they could, for the first time, be masters in their own right. And as the gigas were born of both titankind and the planes, so were the gigas\\' spawn, the giants. Within the lands the gigas settled arose new beings, whole races specially adapted to life within their specific environs. With the march of countless epochs the titans waned, and so did their children, and their children\\'s children. Today, titans remain rare, little-known even among the planes, declining as they suffer from the wounds of an ages-old conflict. The gigas, too, stand distant, removing to the frontiers of realms they once mastered-Hell gigas picking across the ruins of mountain fastnesses, Maelstrom gigas coasting ether storms upon islands of reality, Nirvana gigas crafting and dominating new dominions of dreams, and countless more withdrawing in the face of extinction. Even on the mortal plane, the age of giants has passed on most worlds, with the great beings of ancient times retreating in the face of countless lesser races, devoid of the giants\\' might yet powerful in numbers. Some draw a connection between humans (as well as some other races) and giants suggestive of a heritage similar to that of giants, gigas, and the titans before them, yet from the limited vantage of mortal lives, few definite corollaries can be made. Perhaps in future eons the truth of such conjecture might make itself apparent to the inheritors of humankind.'},\n",

Barbs and hooks hang from these wrought iron bands, matching the fiend's tail as they writhe like snakes in search of prey.\",\n",
       "   'description': \"Sadistic hunters and tormentors of all living souls, ephialtes kytons usually roam the planes in service to the lords of Hell and Shadow, but occasionally in pursuit of their own fell interests. They ruthlessly abduct the innocent and retrieve the damned, dragging their victims into the fires of Hell or the gnashing, wailing dark of the Plane of Shadow. They have no fear, tracking their chosen prey regardless of distance or challenge, and shackle dragons, giants, and humanoids alike for their eternal torturous rewards. Ephialtes kytons travel in silent grace while cloaked in darkness, but drop their stealthy veils when ready to intimidate those they've come to collect or punish. Then, their frightening gaze matches the deadly intent of the chains piercing their flesh. These animated, wrought iron bands serve as protection and weapons in the hands or claws of all kytons, but may also bind and lash their victims to the ephialtes' ever-bleeding hide to carry them into the Great Beyond. A typical ephialtes stands 25 feet tall and weighs over 15 tons with the combined burden of their deadly chains. Ecology An ephialtes kyton results from the ritual transformation of a lesser kyton which has slain or bound 999 mortal victims in the soulless dark of the Shadow Plane. Thereafter, it gains the ability to shadow walk and expand its access to other planes without waiting for summoners to request its services. Eternally vigilant and opportunistic, ephialtes kytons hunt for further victims for young kytons to practice upon. Because of their honed expertise in capturing and tormenting souls, ephialtes are highly useful to the diabolical elite-both mortals and the immortal lords of Hell-who seek out ephialtes kytons as fell servants. Some kytons willingly align themselves with the rulers of Hell, taking further delight in the various torments available in that realm. Habitat & Society Ephialtes kytons shepherd and rule over the entirety of kyton society. Though not especially cunning compared to other fiends, they still possess a fierce loyalty to their own kind and adhere to a rigid hierarchy of power and achievement. Their homes within the Plane of Shadow remain eternally hidden, with the sounds of flesh-flensing chains providing the only insight into their torturous methods. Few outsiders understand the purpose of these elaborate torments, though rumors suggest they further empower the ephialtes to ever-greater transformations. Summoning Ephialtes Kytons As long as a conjurer doesn't interrupt an ongoing hunt, most ephialtes kytons relish being summoned, looking forward to the sport of chasing down newly assigned prey or punishing those who fail to properly bind them. Any Charisma check made as part of the greater planar binding spell to convince an ephialtes kyton to undertake a mission other than the murder, abduction, or torture of specific victims suffers a -2 penalty. Once an ephialtes kyton accepts an assignment, it demands 1,000 gp paid in black onyx or opals for every Hit Die its target possesses. If the summoner cannot pay the price in the required gems, the kyton only partially carries out the requested service-maiming instead of murdering, abducting for only a limited time (typically 1d4+3 days), or only torturing a victim until it answers a single question as part of an interrogation. If a summoner tries to force an ephialtes kyton to perform a different type of service or accept a different form of payment, the kyton takes offense and all of the summoner's future Charismarelated interactions with the ephialtes suffer a -2 penalty. Once an ephialtes kyton has agreed to a task, only its assigned prey interests it. Ephialtes kytons always offer to dispose of such victims by taking them to the Shadow Plane so they can help lesser kytons obtain the necessary number of souls to become ephialtes.\"},\n",

       "   'description': \"Drekavacs are the undead remains of children who perished from disease, particularly in plague-ridden areas where many such deaths occurred in a short period of time. Able to become as insubstantial as the mist rising from a graveyard on a cold, dark night, drekavacs are carriers of disease, seeking to infect the living with the afflictions that slew them. According to some stories, drekavacs only result from young plague victims who remain unburied or died bereft of the proper funeral rites; performing those rites may allow their spirits to rest and no longer haunt the world of the living. Ecology Drekavacs typically haunt desolate places, from windswept plains and mountains to dark forests and abandoned homes or villages. They may move among inhabited areas in gaseous form, but are typically warded off by bright lights and the sounds and sights of life. They are always encountered indoors or at night, preferring dark, cloudy or foggy nights, ideally during the waning moon. Drekavacs are usually encountered during the gloomy, cold winter months rather than in the spring or summer. Rural clerics and adepts must sometimes deal with one or more drekavacs seeking to spread disease in their communities. Their favored targets are children, some of whom can also become drekavacs 3 days after death unless their bodies are burned and the ashes scattered. The work of drekavacs in a community can sometimes lead to hysterical accusations by grief-stricken parents and families, stirring up resentment and violence toward outsiders or anyone suspected of involvement with unnatural forces. It is customary in some rural areas to surround a child's crib with a ring of blessed salt to keep evil influences at bay, including drekavacs, who cannot cross an unbroken line of salt. However, drekavacs can convince others to break the line of salt for them. Habitat & Society Drekavacs are lonesome, bitter, and pitiful creatures, often crying when they appear, mourning their lost lives. Some folk mistake them for living children, lost or starving, although the creatures are not very effective liars. Still, a dim night and a half-seen form huddled and sobbing pitifully are often enough to trick someone into approaching close enough to become victim of the drekavac's chilling grasp. Once they have inflicted their plagues upon victims, drekavacs quickly lose interest and move on, although they may follow a victim, begging for aid and attention, behaving as if they were still living victims of disease rather than its agents. They rarely kill victims outright, preferring instead to inflict long and lingering deaths through disease. Drekavacs threatened with salt, magic, or silver weapons become vicious, attacking opponents like snarling dogs until they are dead or the creatures are driven off. Drekavacs sometimes band together in small packs, particularly in places where epidemics or plagues have swept through a population, either recently or long ago, but they have no real organization beyond seeking out new victims to infect. Drekavacs are intelligent and aware, able to converse in Common, or whatever languages they knew in life. This means some drekavacs are only able to communicate in largely dead or forgotten languages. They are childlike in their understanding and largely incapable of being reasoned with, but deft use of Bluff or Diplomacy and a playful or parental tone may keep a drekavac at bay, at least temporarily.\"},\n",

       "   'description': \"Powerful and swift land mammals, elk range through the plains, hills, and forests of many wildernesses, in great herds. Related to deer, elk prove important parts of many ecologies, being able to fend off or flee many threats while feeding greater predators. Their size, strength, and antlers-reaching up to 10 feet wide on some males-allow them to contend with most of their environment's dangers, though herds generally favor flight to combat. Elk also prove exceptionably adaptable and remarkable survivors, capable of living through severe changes in weather and in a variety of environments without concern. Many humanoid cultures rely on elk herds, using them as valued food sources, work animals, and companions. Most breeds of elk stand between 3 and 5 feet tall and weigh between 350 and 550 pounds, with females being far slighter than males. Heartier stock, such as the river elk seen throughout the River Kingdoms, Brevoy, and much of northern Avistan and Iobaria, grow to approximately 6 feet tall and weigh between 700 and 1,100 pounds. In some secluded wilds, primeval megaloceros-massive ancestors of the elk-still flourish, standing up to 9 feet tall, with bulks of 1,500 pounds and antlers growing over 12 feet wide. In all species, only male elk grow antlers. Female elk have the same statistics as males, but lack the gore or powerful charge attacks. Ecology Elk live relatively long lives for herd animals, with some bulls living for over 15 years. Physiologically, they're similar to deer and other grazing animals with their patterns of travel and interaction with other creatures. Because of their size, though, they can damage an ecosystem, eating great amounts of food and sometimes competing with other herbivores for resources. Bull elk keep their antlers for about 7 to 8 months of the year, maintaining them as a primary form of defense. The antlers of common elk stand 4 feet tall and spread about 6 feet wide. Both bulls and cows are quite strong, their kicks proving deadly deterrents against many would-be attackers. Most breeds of elk stay in herds with upwards of 50 members. Herd members actively protect each other, doing what they can to defend those incapable of fleeing, yet also recognizing hopeless causes. Very few predators can stand up to a group of defensive elk, though wolves, bears, boars, and hunting cats often attack the young, sick, or unwary who venture away from the herd. While most natural predators steer clear of elk herds, many humanoid or monstrous hunters manage to pick off elk by relying on ranged weapons or great physical prowess. Habitat & Society During most of the year, elk maintain large groups of their own genders. Cows and the young tend to stick near dens, so bulls are more likely to be found wandering their wide territories. During mating season, a dominant bull maintains a harem of as many as 20 cows. Any threat to that establishment is met with violent force, with battles between rivals often resulting in fierce clashing of antlers and contests of strength-though such rarely prove deadly. During mating season, cows don't always produce offspring, though when they do, typically only one or two elk are born. After mating season, cows care for calves for only a short time. Most are only nursed for a couple of months before they join with the rest of the herd. Elk are hibernating creatures, being almost unheard of during the winter season. During the remainder of the year, they roam and graze widely. When they make their tell-tale noise (called bugling,) it booms and echoes for miles, and females often consider the loudest males the most suitable as mates. Elk migrate throughout the year, typically to avoid the snow. They move from low to high ground, where tree bark is an abundant food source. During the summer months, they graze on the grasses they can find. During dry seasons, elk often make great trips to find abundant food sources, which can sometimes force out lesser creatures from a habitat. Elk are also know to vary widely from region to region. Common in Brevoy, the River Kingdoms, and secluded spots of Numeria, river elks prove larger and heartier than most of their brethren. Named for their tendencies to travel along rivers and the comfort with which they enter water, these elk exhibit a daring unknown to most other breeds, the bulls willingly fighting to defend their herds from any perceived threats. Megaloceros Similar in form to the elk but far superior in size is the megaloceros. The average male is a towering, dangerous creature with antlers that can alone weigh nearly 100 pounds. Unlike elk, megaloceros antlers are decidedly enormous and sometimes wider than their bodies are long. This leads to common misconceptions and exaggerations about the creature's monstrous size. Conveniently for those pursued, megaloceros males have difficultly navigating thickly forested areas, making them natives of plains and the woods' edge.

       "   'description': 'Grotesque nomads native to wretched plains and barren hills, thawns seem to bear the curse of both nature and the divine. Ogre-like in stature and dimwittedness, these monstrously ugly humanoids bear fold upon fold of sagging, excess flesh, draping them in wrinkled, poxriddled hides. This wretched appearance, in tandem with their great size and monstrous claws, leads most creatures to shun them. Indeed, even thawns find one another repulsive, creating a barely tolerable society of universal mistrust and loathing. Thawns average 9 feet tall and their excess skin pushes their average weight to 700 pounds. Ecology Often called \"mud giants\" due to the foul, mottled skin that hangs loosely from their misshapen frames, thawns are universally malformed and dreadful, though each is quite distinctive in its singular monstrousness. Hair only grows in small tufts-thick, oily, and black. Their eyes easily pick up the flaws in their appearance, driving them to hide their figures as much as possible. Such revulsion of their form has led many scholars to hypothesize that thawns once possessed a different one, potentially relating them directly to ogres, hill giants, or other humanoids victimized by the hands of some more powerful and malicious race. Such possibilities remain nothing more than conjecture, however, as the brutes have no ability and even less interest in retaining details of their history. Even with this overpowering self-loathing, ancient instincts drive thawns together for safety and procreation, and no other race tolerates their ugliness and savagery. Opportunistic feeders, thawns seek out fresh battlefields and the scraps of slain beasts, reluctantly sharing their pickings with other parasites and scavengers. Alone as they wander the lands, thawns take care of their own needs first and foremost, caring little for others of their kind. Disdaining anything like a fair fight, they excel at crafting clever decoys and simple traps. Though sizable creatures, thawns typically strive to draw as little attention to themselves as possible, preferring to craft convincing dummies from mud, stone, and animal carcasses while they wait in hiding. Habitat & Society Most thawns collect in nomadic groups, wandering grim plains and moody hills more like ravaging gangs than tribes traveling out of necessity. While their dim intellects provide them the most basic tools to seek out what they need to survive, their lives prove pitiful and often violently short. Hateful of themselves and their own kind, thawns aspire to no great works. Their nomadism thus comes less from need as from indifference, as one ugly hillside or leaking cave proves little better or worse than any other. It\\'s their own inhabitance that causes most thawns to move on, as once they\\'ve despoiled an area, it\\'s then time to find new lands. This cycle of pillaging and pressing on proves uncomfortable to most thawns, but most lack the foresight to live any other way. Groups of thawns prove highly changeable, with members joining and leaving with little hesitation. As no love is lost between members, the savages drift apart as the whim takes them. Typically such changes in group structure go ignored, unless those left behind believe their former kinsman possesses some valuable information or reason for departing. Thawns don\\'t believe in hoarding material possessions, disdaining most metals and valuables in part because shiny surfaces invariably betray their monstrous visages to them. They use whatever is nearest at hand to satisfy their basic needs, though some carry with them items of simple usefulness or trophies of brutal victories. They move away from defended and civilized areas out of simple survival instinct, but attack small groups of humanoids if driven to desperation. Occasionally some uninformed samaritan attempts to take pity on a thawn, believing it cast out merely for its appearance and simplicity. Such charity typically proves fatal, though, as in the case of these hulks, their outward ugliness matches a dull-witted sadism and raving, violent hatred of all living things. Even ogres, with whom they hold many similarities, revile thawns as mindless killers and bogeymen, attacking and slaying them on sight. If mud giants excel at any one thing, it\\'s physical deception. Knowing most creatures\\' hatred of them and their widespread treatment as dangerous lepers, they have learned to hide themselves where no sane creature would lurk and deceive eyes that would seek them with loathing. Thus, thawns willingly lair and hide amid filth-choked pools, muddy ravines, rotting bogs, and worse places. To aid them in their ambushes, they often create cunningly hidden pits, similar simple traps, and, most notoriously, decoys. With their misshapen frames, it\\'s not difficult to mistake a tall, awkward pile of mud and rocks covered in rags for a thawn, while the reverse also proves dangerously true. More than one wary traveler, sighting a thawn-like shape upon a low hillock or on a dusty trail, has circled widely to avoid the dangerous hunter only to blunder into the ambush of the true thawn lurking in wait. Treasure Thawns rarely keep any possessions other than those which they can carry, these typically being crude or foul items even the most desperate wayfarers wouldn\\'t consider clothing or food. In filthy sacks or-even more revoltingly-slung in useful flesh folds, there is a 40% chance that any thawn possesses 1d4 unsettling items, typically scraps of skin, leather, and stolen cloth for the creation of new cloaks; trophies of skulls, bones, and hide bound into crude fetishes; and rotting animal meat of unwholesome cuts and uncertain origin. Such things are typically soiled beyond use and rarely valuable, but often suggest what victims the mud giant has recently preyed upon and where their foul wanderings have led them.'},\n",

       "   'description': \"Thylacines are large marsupial carnivores. They typically hunt alone, only occasionally forming small packs. Thylacines hunt at night, and rest during the day in nests hidden away from the world in hollowed trees or bushes. Farmers fear the creatures, blaming all manner of problems on them. However, thylacines are quite shy and antisocial, and usually avoid human settlements. Because of their odd, almost hybrid appearance, thylacines have a far harsher reputation than they probably should, playing a sort of bogeyman role in farming communities. Ecology At a distance, thylacines are sometimes mistaken for dogs or jackals, but can be easily identified by the defining stripes on their gold-hued backs. Thylacines usually have between 13 and 21 dark stripes. Their muscular jaws, filled with teeth, can gape open to an impressive 120 degrees. While thylacines may appear rather quick, they are far from proficient runners. Due to their oddly shaped legs, their run is awkward and slow. However, the animals can stand on their haunches for short periods, helping them to fend off other predators and kill larger prey. Thylacines are also capable jumpers, not dissimilar to kangaroos, and often surprise opponents with this ability. By most standards, a thylacine's senses aren't impressive. They can see and hear well enough to hunt prey, but their olfactory senses, while competent, do not approach canine levels. Thylacines hunt in a manner similar to wolves, focusing on wearing down prey by chasing and harrying instead of direct attacks. Their stomachs are able to greatly distend, enabling thylacines to eat vast amounts of food in a single sitting, devouring larger animals to compensate for long periods of drought or poor hunting. Thylacines are quite cowardly, avoiding confrontation whenever possible. If cornered, a thylacine tries to frighten off attackers with growls, hisses, and threat-yawns, in which it displays its teeth and the full extent of its wide jaws. If these threat displays are ineffective, however, a thylacine does not hesitate to attack. Their powerful jaws may not snap bones, but they can still make quick work of an unprepared traveler. In addition, thylacines are not picky eaters. If driven to starvation, they aren't afraid to hunt humans, in which case their nocturnal hunting cycles tend to lead them to attack sleeping travelers or outlying farms. Thylacines are fiercely independent. While wolves and other canines can be tamed and domesticated, thylacines are wild without exception. If captured, they become territorial and mark everything they can in their territories with strong-smelling odors from their scent glands. Many a farmer has made the sad mistake of attempting to domesticate a thylacine, only to find his farm smelling atrocious and his livestock killed in the night. An adult thylacine stands 2 feet tall at the shoulder, is 4 feet long (not counting an additional 2 feet of tail), and weighs roughly 50 pounds. The larger and more aggressive brush thylacine breed can reach almost 8 feet long from nose to tail-tip, though still only weighing 100 pounds. Habitat & Society Thylacines breed year-round, but like most marsupials, they don't maintain strong family ties. Females keep their young in pouches. Unlike many marsupials, males also have pouches, but these are to protect their genitals, not their young. Females produce about 10 viable joeys in a given breeding season, but only about four can expect to see more than a year of life. The average thylacine lives between 4 and 10 years. Thylacines keep dens similar to those of plains mammals such as foxes and cougars. Dens are often very hard to find, in trees, caves, or other inconvenient locations out of the way of most predators, and in natural shade. Thylacine young reside in the den for only a short period, as joeys stay in their mothers' pouches for most of their development. During periods when a mother is incubating her young, she can be downright violent to trespassers or any other potential threats. Regional Variants Several breeds of thylacine are known to exist, hunting plains and woodlands in regions of Avistan, Garund, and beyond. Three of the most common are noted here. Blood Cougar: Not actually related to the big cats, Tian thylacines are known as blood cougars for their vivid red coloring. Surprisingly, they are often kept as pets by Tian-La leaders, as blood cougars are more easily domesticated and tamed, and serve as far better companions and hunting aids. Although they are slightly smaller than normal thylacines, they make up for it in ferocity and cunning. These red beasts have the advanced creature template (Pathfinder RPG Bestiary 294). Casmar Thylacine: In Casmaron, most thylacines are smaller than the typical beast. For this reason, they tend to form larger packs, often twice the size of an average thylacine pack. These smaller beasts stand 6 inches to a foot shorter at the shoulders. Casmar thylacines are normal thylacines with the young creature template added (Pathfinder RPG Bestiary 295), and gather in packs of 2-10. Sarusan Wolf: The Sarusan wolf is a slightly bigger and more doglike form of the normal thylacine. Whereas indigenous people refer to the thylacine as a lion or other great cat, the Sarusan wolf has an unmistakable canine jaw.

       "   'description': 'Little-known denizens of the Darklands, rorkouns prey upon the unwary from lairs amid the deepest pools and waterways. Known as \"wretch worms\" and \"eyes of Orv,\" these disgusting abominations writhe through flooded pits and crevices, feeding upon nearly all they encounter and occasionally breaking forth from the depths into the world of light to glut themselves upon the plump, tender creatures found there. Rorkouns measure over 25 feet in length, and beneath the strange secretions that provide them with a false, apparent bulk, the creatures possess a ribbon-thin body only a foot wide. A typical rorkoun weighs a mere 200 pounds. Ecology Little is known of the anatomy and life processes of rorkouns because of both their rarity and their fundamental dependency on water. As soon as a rorkoun leaves the water-which none ever do willingly, even to pursue the most tempting prey-it begins dehydrating at a deadly rate. Most that are ripped from their native pools wither to long strips of jerky-like flesh in a few short minutes. Thus, much of what is known of the beasts comes from direct observation, a methodology that proves dangerous for most researchers. Rorkouns possess lengthy bodies similar to tapeworms, with simple, decentralized bodily systems. Their flat, oblong heads branch into four split mouthparts set on throat-like stalks. At the top of the head, a single, bulging eye scans the creature\\'s surroundings with uncanny sensitivity. Their heads are the thickest parts of their bodies, which taper gradually to a powerful tail. The strangest quality of these creatures is that their body exudes a rubbery, gluelike substance that swiftly hardens into a flexible, puttylike mass. Rorkouns use these secretions to better protect their bodies, seal off their chosen lairs (to prevent water from seeping out), and capture their prey. Several explorers who have encountered rorkouns have spread unnerving stories regarding the beasts, suggesting that rorkouns are not individual creatures but rather the impossibly long appendages of some unknown aberrant body. Their hesitance to leave the water is thus claimed to be because they are incapable of separating themselves from their greater body; the frantic thrashing of rorkoun that are forcibly removed from the water as they struggle to return is compared to the final desperate twitches of an amputated limb. What terrible body might support limbs as vile as rorkouns few dare to conjecture, but whatever hidden beings (or more terrible still, single being) manipulate these horrors from the darkness must be unlike anything known to the denizens of Golarion\\'s surface-and must hunger endlessly. Habitat & Society Solitary creatures, rorkoun rarely share hunting grounds. Most, upon encountering another of their kind, attempt to leave the vicinity, avoiding any sort of confrontation and often ridding the area of both creatures. This aversion proves baffling, especially considering the extreme rarity of the beasts, though some suggest that the abominations might prove more receptive toward others of their kind when far below the surface. Those scholars who study rorkouns claim the strange beasts understand both the Common language and that of goblins, though most believe the creatures also have a silent language used among their own kind-despite the creatures\\' tendency to avoid contact with one another. They frequently live near goblin and mite communities. While these species share an ecological niche as scavengers and occasional hunters, the connection is a bit more complex. Rorkouns never hunt goblins or mites as they find the taste of their flesh repulsive. The creatures do, however, find the savory flavor of greater humanoids succulent; they appreciate the zeal with which those races seek to exterminate goblinkind, as it brings prey close to their lairs for them to feast on. Cowardly and secretive, rorkouns lurk in murky pools or bogs near such creatures\\' camps, hoping to provoke a fight. Once the battle begins, rorkouns strike, picking off the weakest creatures in the fray before slinking off to digest the meal in the privacy of their dens or some other location where their prey\\'s allies might find it difficult to follow. A rorkoun\\'s benefactors rarely understand the reason for this strange kind of cooperation. While mites tend to fear and flee the aberrations-just as they do most creatures-goblins often concoct more elaborate reasons for why these alien horrors might aid them. Typically, a particularly imaginative goblin convinces his tribe that the rorkoun is in fact a god and that they are its chosen people. All too often this inspires the community to new heights of crazed zealotry and the invention of bizarre forms of sacrifice and adoration. Occasionally rorkouns find their way into the dilapidated or abandoned sewer systems of ruined or declining cities where the shattered remains of such networks have collapsed and formed connections to the Darklands. There rorkouns crawl and swim their way through the slick tunnels and drainpipes, feeding on refuse, vermin, and the occasional sewer dweller or rat catcher. Such unusual beasts rarely prove significant threats, emerging to menace the surface only through what abandoned tunnels and drainage ditches they might happen upon.'},\n",

       "   'description': \"The mysterious blodeuwedds stand apart from dryads, their tree-bound sisters of the forest, instead watching over the open plains and prairies. They frequently guard the approaches to primeval, fey enclaves as well as various gateways and entry points into the First World-a task they take very seriously. Blodeuwedds hide such regions behind veils of illusion and trickery, quietly observing anyone passing through their lands, and occasionally sending mysterious messages to warn them away or to summon allies that can drive them out. Even when not standing sentinel over a point of otherworldly importance, blodeuwedds find spots of particular natural beauty, transforming such fields-usually only a few acres in size-into sites of unearthly lushness and natural wonder. A typical blodeuwedd stands a little over 5 feet tall, weighs 120 pounds, and may live up to 800 years. Ecology Instead of developing a lifelong bond with trees, blodeuwedds hold an affinity for open grasslands, moors, and plains. They survive off the land, taking nourishment from all that nature provides, while also looking after prairie animals in times of drought or lean winters. Unlike dryads, blodeuwedds have no dependency on the plants around them; they can willingly leave their chosen moor to visit their fey kin, scout their domain in owl form, or even mingle with frontier communities, changing shape to appear elven or human. Every 15 or so years, blodeuwedds may reproduce through a natural ritual of fertility known as the Blooming, a process by which they commune with the adopted plants of their surrounding field. At the height of the spring season, they then exchange pollen with every flower within 300 yards, a complicated and sensuous act that eventually allows a blodeuwedd to conceive. It takes 6 months to carry a new blodeuwedd to term, and they frequently come together to act as midwives during this time to ensure successful deliveries for one another. Some tales tell of blodeuwedds displaced from their homes or in captivity capable of performing the Blooming by drawing off the lifeforce of amorous men, ending in the withering death of the would-be father. Such legends give blodeuwedds a reputation for being dangerous seductresses in some regions. Blodeuwedds typically establish their own prairie holdings within 7 miles of each other for mutual support and ease of communication. Habitat & Society Blodeuwedds make their homes out of sod, carving them from the landscape and then encouraging prairie grass to grow over the exterior to hide them. These elaborate structures resemble small rises and hillocks that overlook ley lines and fairy paths between sites of great power and importance to the fey, which the blodeuwedds jealously guard from nonfey creatures. Most fey recognize such service by referring to blodeuwedds with honorific titles meant to curry their favor. As a result, many blodeuwedds set themselves up as queens or wardens to receive tribute from favored kin who pass through their realms. Blodeuwedds also rely on plant growth and their ability to speak with plants to manage the surrounding fields, encouraging them to grow into complex mazes of hedgerows, tangles, and thickets to better shape their territory. Often they use hallucinatory terrain to hide the best routes through these areas. Interlopers typically find themselves impeded by entangle or areas of spike growth when they enter a blodeuwedd's territory. Any who persist then become targeted by deep slumber or modify memory to lead them in false directions. More rarely, a blodeuwedd might aid one on an important quest, but she usually requires some form of guarantee before agreeing to do so. All blodeuwedds possess tremendous knowledge of and influence over the lands and creatures that border their fields. They often involve themselves in the politics of elves, gnomes, and humans who live nearby-even if only to warn against destructive trespasses or wasteful farming practices. They enjoy playing wind flutes, dancing under the stars, and chasing one another's fairy lights like fireflies among the tall grass. Blodeuwedd Queens Particularly old and active blodeuwedds-typically the eldest within a region that more than 10 blodeuwedds inhabit-sometimes ascend to the status of queens, gaining additional power and prestige among their own kind. They develop a greater affinity for the lands they rule and attract even more followers. The following adjustments to a standard blodeuwedd represent a young blodeuwedd queen at CR 8. More powerful varieties typically add class levels in druid or sorcerer, both of which are considered favored classes for a blodeuwedd queens. • 9 Hit Dice • +2 natural armor • +4 Strength, +6 Constitution, +6 Charisma • Additional Spell-Like Abilities (Sp): Always active-endure elements, nondetection; At will-create water, detect animals or plants; 3/day-command plants, move earth, summon nature's ally IV; 1/ day-fire seeds, plant shape II.

       "   'description': \"Clawbats, or einchadu, as they're known to the tribes of greater Iobaria, haunt the desolate expanses of northeastern Avistan and the rugged lands beyond. Swarming forth from their shadowy dens to hunt by night, these strange predators thirst for blood, scavenging from the victims of greater nocturnal hunters and stalking those foolish enough not to fear dangers in the dark. Drawn by the scent of spilled blood, clawbats fearlessly follow deadly beasts, and more than one traveler has narrowly escaped a predator's nearly lethal ambush only to find his luck change as a swarm of wings and eyes descend upon him. The span of an average clawbat's dual pairs of wings stretches 3 feet wide, lifting aloft rubbery bodies weighing 2 to 4 pounds. Tales of more monstrous clawbats, with wings that blot out the stars as they swoop away with children and small animals, also pass through the civilized lands of Iobaria. Such overgrown clawbats might be constructed by making use of the giant creature simple template. Ecology Clawbats are scavengers and opportunistic hunters. They rarely attack creatures larger than rodents or birds unless the creatures-or those traveling with them-have been weakened by a stronger attacker. Even the presence of such a hunter is not enough to deter an ever-hungry clawbat, which is drawn to attack bloodied creatures in the thick of battle. Clawbats are poor fighters; they prefer to fly past victims, strike quickly to draw blood, and then make pass after pass, aggravating their victims' existing wounds with their ribbon-like tongues. This tactic rarely wins the scavengers more than a drop or two of nourishment per attack, driving them to harass a victim until it drops. When the wounds of clawbats' prey prove too insignificant to fell it, clawbats attack more directly, circling to peel away strip after strip of flesh in wet grabs of their tentacular maws. After their prey has fallen to the pain of a dozen such wounds, clawbats land and vigorously lap up their meal until their bellies are bloated with gore. Aiding clawbats in their hunts is their acrid saliva, a stinging milky-white fluid that possesses an anticoagulant quality, causing their bites to leave messy wounds that bleed until treated. This effect allows clawbats to surprise attack most Small creatures and wait safely out of reach until the prey collapses. Healthy larger prey can typically withstand the assault of a lone clawbat, but a whole clutch of the creatures might easily throw even a sturdy beast into panicked, bleeding terror. The freedom with which clawbat wounds bleed also serves to attract other clawbats in the vicinity, and a few scratches might potentially bring an entire clutch down upon even a slightly wounded creature. Clawbat eyes are exceedingly abnormal, being nearly flat, yet still functional. As the creatures' eyes are set upon their wings, the constant flapping gives the clawbats a constantly shifting view of the area around them, but particularly the land below-an experience which would seem terribly jarring to any creature not used to the experience. The eyes are one-sided, occupying only the inner part of their thick, fleshy wings, and are lidless, being constantly watered by ducts surrounding each eye. The profuse watering of these organs causes clawbats to fling a fine spray as they move, which often serves as a victim's first warning of impending danger. Other flying creatures, such as hawks, eagles, and owls, make up the clawbats' natural predators. The sounds of these raptors can dissuade clawbats from attacking, even in the midst of a feeding frenzy, and will send them winging straight for their roost to avoid attack. Giant centipedes occasionally invade clawbat lairs, crawling up the wall or waiting for their prey at the exit. Clawbats have little natural defense against creatures with thick exoskeletons and avoid them when it is possible to attack an easier source of food. Clawbats can live up to 20 years, though most die earlier due to predation, accidents, or infighting. Habitat & Society Clawbats are found far from heavily civilized lands, though whether this is due to civilized efforts to stamp them out or because they prefer distant, half-wild places is open to debate. They live in clutches of up to 15 members, favoring dark places that offer easy aerial access to the outside world. Each of these places must have a roost that allows the creatures to drop the 15 feet necessary to begin flying; if a stationary clawbat attempts to start flying without sufficient drop, it glides to the ground and must mount to a higher point before it can launch again. This makes them skittish in claustrophobic spaces, for they do not like to be at a disadvantage, and this in turn leads them to infest places such as ruined structures, large, open caves, and fissures. New clutches of clawbats contain 4 to 6 young members, which depart a clutch once it has grown to exceed 15 members. The young fly 10 to 15 miles away, searching for a suitable structure or crag to shield them during the day. Once a group of clawbats leaves its original home, the members feel no loyalty to their former family and compete fiercely for resources. On numerous occasions, mages, druids, and barbarians shamans have attempted to capture and train clawbats. While the creatures' awkwardness once they are brought to ground makes them relatively easy to capture-though frustratingly difficult to restrain given their flexibility and many squirming limbs-no documented attempt to train the beasts has ever succeeded. Even efforts paired with steady diets of blood typically end in the clawbat attacking its keeper just as often as availing themselves of the easier food source. This, and their regular attempts to feed even when critically wounded, have won the creatures a reputation for being dumbly vicious, a reputation that leads most thinking creatures to curse and move quickly to exterminate any clawbats that appear in their lands.\"},\n",

Shattered black teeth jut from a chapped, lipless mouth that stretches beneath a high, scarred brow devoid of nose or eyes.',\n",
       "   'description': \"Withered hermits wrapped in tattered black rags, these scarred, eyeless crones slip through the dark crevasses of both earth and time. Degenerate inheritors of the half-remembered, collapsed cyclops civilizations, the stygiras-or stone witches, as they are often called-command strange secrets of the earth and interpret the fateful energies of the depths. Ages of communion with the darkness and reliance upon alien magics have corrupted the stygiras from the primitive human witches their ancestors were countless ages ago, transforming them into a terrifying, debased breed infused with magics not their own. In many a savage land, these crones were once or are still worshiped as seers and demigods, weaving magic and communing with the earth to manipulate their servants into obeying their selfish and grotesque whims. In other realms, they haunt the night, prowling from their caves to feed upon the unwary or make alliances with those cruel and ambitious enough to believe their perverse counsel. Yet for all their perverse blasphemies and primitive desires, their powers to see what none should and reduce life to brittle stone proves enough to inspire dread and superstitious belief in nearly all who hear of the harsh stone witches. Stygiras on average stand 6-1/2 feet tall and weigh approximately 150 pounds. Ecology It is said that the stygiras draw their power from stone and from the darkness. Certainly they live their entire lives in the dark, traveling through intricate, maze-like caverns and the moonless sky with equal ease. They draw their sustenance from the base things they scrape from the earth-vermin, molds, lichens, and whatever fleshy things happen into their lairs. Although technically blind, stygiras have almost supernaturally keen hearing, taste, and touch, and so have no need for sight. What remains of the eyes that lurk as vestigial elements of their anatomy hide beneath the scarred flesh of their faces. While such remnant organs typically go unused, they can still detect the presence of light, an uncomfortable sensation that all stygiras take great pains to avoid. Stygiras can in fact travel under the skies, but they quickly become agoraphobic and retreat to the safety of shadowy canyons or caves as soon as possible. They avoid the sunlight hours, with most willing to face death in the darkness rather than take their chances venturing into the light. All stygiras are female; they are capable of reproducing with humanoids of nearly any species and always bearing three or more withered-and typically stillborn-stygira young. Yet stygiras make up for their appallingly low live birth and survival rates with unnaturally long lifespans. None can say how long stygiras who don't meet their end by violence might live, but instances of stone witches living for 3 or more centuries are well documented. Habitat & Society Stygiras most commonly occupy lands near the phenomenally ancient tombs and monuments of the cyclops empires. While some of the crazed witches make the impossible claim that all stygira are the surviving mortal apprentices of primordial cyclops seers, saner minds posit that the predecessors of these crones were primitive human shamans and mystics who managed to tap into a degree of the fallen empires' powers. Whatever the case, the connection between stygiras and the ancient cyclopes lingers in their shared language and the mad scrawls covering many of these hags' lairs.\"},\n",

In addition to their elf-like forms, they can take the shape of whirlwinds of dust, snow, or sand. In the mortal realm, they are often mistaken for djinn. They delight in violent weather, not for the destructive qualities of such events, but for the intensity and energy, and many tales describe bralani as spirits who laugh as they sail amid the strongest storms. Bralanis do not need to eat, but they enjoy doing so. Most prefer elven food, fiery human dishes, and spiced wine. Because of their similarities to elementals and fey, they sometimes act as intermediaries between mortals, elementals, and fey, though they prefer to arrange temporary truces that allow the interested parties to conduct their own negotiations on neutral ground. When taking the role of mediators-or whenever else such opportunities present themselves-bralani are quick to suggest friendly competitions or games to end disputes and enjoy creating challenges or complicated contests to test both physical and mental mortal prowess.'},\n",

They also love unspoiled wilderness and seek out places in the mortal realm that remind them of the beauty of their home plane. From the lore of numerous races come tales of these muses, particularly those that have taken a vested interest in the training of a single talented prodigy or the ongoing creation of some fantastic work of art. Such legends sometimes prove true, as all lillends have their favorite works, creations, and artists, and often visit the Material Plane to enjoy their splendor and make sure they remain safe.

Whether this intelligence is the product of evolution or meddling by unholy powers, all angazhani honor the demon lord Angazhan. Reclusive by nature, high girallon clans settle the most secluded depths of the jungles, generally inhabiting ruined cities and misty mountain temples. There they rule as divine priestkings over tribes of lesser apes. These congregations sometimes even include humanoid slaves or cultists, though the angazhani prefer raiding and collect tribute over commanding direct service. They rarely reveal themselves to outsiders, and instead quietly gather strength against the day their patron sends them out to claim all the world's forests. High girallons stand 9 feet tall and weigh nearly a thousand pounds. They often dress in hides, and they fight with exotically shaped throwing axes or sacrificial knives.\"},\n",

It stands just over five feet tall, holding its head and thorax upright while clutching an intricately carved hunting spear in two clawed forelimbs. Powerful mandibles click in rhythm with the reed-thin antennae waving upon its head as if testing the air for the scent of prey.\",\n",
       "   'description': \"Bog striders call themselves Ses'h in Aquan, but the first explorers to encounter them named the reclusive bug-men after their ability to stride on water like solid ground. Individual bog striders resemble upright beetles with four legs, two arms, and powerful mandibles. They depend on their waterborne speed to quickly chase down prey and flee from predators. Otherwise, they care little for civilizations other than their own, rarely venturing from the swampy rivers and lakes they call home. The long, spindly legs of bog striders give the impression of a greater size then their relatively fragile frames actually account for. Although their limbs are in most cases more than double, even triple, the length of other humanoids, their inflexible joints grant them little more mobility, range of motion, and capability to reach than others. Regardless of gender, nearly all bog striders stand 5 feet tall and weigh approximately 150 pounds. Ecology Bog striders reproduce during specific seasonal and astrological cycles that occur only two to three times during their entire lifespan-detecting their moment of peak fertility through changes in the weather and tidal effects upon large bodies of water. Thereafter, pregnant females lay a clutch of four to 10 eggs, keeping them submerged and guarding against predators until they hatch 6 months later. The younglings then cling to their mother for the next 3 months as they learn the rudiments of survival and socialization within the tribe. Unfortunately, predators (intelligent or otherwise) often view bog strider eggs and younglings as easy prey. Hatcheries suffer attacks by crocodiles and giant frogs, while birds of prey, boggards, and human hunters pick off younglings who stray from their mothers on the open water. As a result of these reproductive challenges, bog striders struggle to keep pace with other swamp-dwelling cultures, suffering through periods of decline and nearextinction. These difficulties make them increasingly insular and territorial, meeting interlopers with spears more often than diplomacy. A bog strider's diet consists almost entirely of meat. They routinely hunt for fish, crustaceans, or snakes, and occasionally hunt for birds, giant wasps, or dragonflies. They particularly excel at spearfishing and snaring airborne prey with thrown nets. The wide stance of a bog strider's four legs displaces its weight over any body of water by maintaining the surface tension with a cushion of air trapped beneath several small ridges on each foot. While not dissimilar to the motion of minute water-striding insects, for bog striders the motion is aided by some manner of innate magic or other supernatural relationship with the water. Regardless of the source of this ability, it allows them to literally walk on water, though they can also fully submerge and hide below the surface if they desire. Bog striders who survive into adulthood can live up to 60 years. Each youngling develops a varied pattern of mottled gray and brown coloration across its carapace, uniquely distinguishing it from others. These spots tend to fade as bog striders age, causing their elders to all look much alike. Habitat & Societ y Bog striders can survive in all but the coldest of climes, living their entire lives on the rivers, lakes, and bogs where they make their homes. Their society focuses primarily on survival due to the depredations of natural predators and wars with lizardfolk and boggards. Each member of a bog strider tribe, both male and female, learns to defend the tribe at the earliest possible age. In addition, everyone must develop a skill that contributes to the community's prosperity, and by extension, the continued survival of their species. Females serve as the builders of bog strider society. They weave large mats of reeds, rushes, and netting that they coat in waterproof tree sap to trap pockets of air below the water's surface where they can safely build and hide their villages. When not looking after their young, the females continuously expand or replace flooded sections of these communities. Meanwhile, male bog striders act as hunters and gatherers, bringing back enough food to last through harsh winters and times of drought. They also scout the waterways for threats to their community, leaving those who pass through their territory unmolested but fighting off those who attempt to stay or exploit the same resources they depend upon. Frequently small bands also venture far from their native lands, seeking to find new, uninhabited waterways where their imperiled communities might be left in peace. Seer-queens rule over multiple bog strider communities to form secluded tribal unions, acting as religious leaders and reading the river currents or tides to divine the will of Gozreh. Many become clerics or druids worshiping the nature god in its feminine form, though they interpret Gozreh more as a great body of water than a likeness of themselves. Because seer-queens lose their personal markings like any other elder, they are difficult to distinguish from the rest of their community. They often use this advantage to hide among their own people, both to thwart those who would target them and to mingle more freely among their subjects. Bog Strider Seer-Queens Leaders of multiple tribes of bog striders, seer-queens help organize and coordinate efforts to stave off the extinction of their species and interpret the will of nature. The following adjustments to a standard bog strider represent a seer-queen. Many also pursue a deeper faith in Gozreh, attaining class levels as a cleric or druid. +5 natural armor. This replaces the standard bog strider natural armor bonus. +4 Intelligence, +4 Wisdom, +6 Charisma. Seer-queens are smarter, wiser, and more regal than normal bog striders. Water Magic (Sp) While standing upon the water's surface, bog strider seer-queens can cast the following powers as spell-like abilities: 3/day-create water, purify food and drink; 1/day-delay poison, fog cloud, quench.\"},\n",

       "   'description': 'Known to grow in the depths of the densest frozen forests, realms where icicles rarely melt from the snow-cloaked trees, calathgars, or \"hail lilies,\" grow to a size and possess an alien beauty that make their cuttings greatly desired in civilized lands. Yet, what few beside the wariest hunters and most knowledgeable denizens of the forests realize is that hail lilies are more than mere flowers-their fully grown varieties possess not only a deadly way of spreading their frozen seeds but also an even more dangerous trait: thought. Known among their own kind as calathgars, these ice-tinged plants move slowly and possess little in the way of society, yet they perceive their surroundings, know when their frigid gardens are threatened, feel pain, and-most tenaciously-seek a chilling revenge when their young are despoiled. The blooms of a fully grown calathgar measures 3 feet in diameter, though some have reported flowers up to 5, 8, and even 10 feet wide. Able to crawl on three tendrillike roots, one of these plants might stand as high as 4 feet off the ground, and when heavy with seeds might weigh as much as 50 pounds. Ecology Calathgars are immediately identifiable, even from a distance, by their sky-blue petals, a color repeated by few other forms of plant life in such size or brilliance. Yet typically, these blooms only unfurl during the brightest hours of the day or when the plants feel threatened. At all other times, calathgars keep their flowers closed, defending the sensitive structures within and presenting large, blue-gray sepals to the outside world. Calathgar young look little different from tall blue flowers-hence many horticulturists identify them merely as hail lilies. It takes nearly a year for a juvenile calathgar to display any kind of concerted movement, aside from the opening and closing of their petals and a few markedly un-plant-like twitches. Their sense of scent and ability to communicate function as soon as their buds first grow-typically within 2 weeks of sprouting from the cold earth. Two rings of sensory organs help calathgars remain aware of their surroundings: a cluster of lobes at the base of the flower and another situated around the stamen within. Both are capable of not just deciphering light in an approximation of visual sight, but also receiving information via a highly developed kind of scent. This sense of smell is much more developed in the plants than their ability to see-though at close ranges their sight can prove just as accurate as most humanoids. To this end, most communication between the plants is scent-based, utterly silent, and often imperceptible to non-plant creatures. At times when the plants feel threatened, however, they exude a smell like vinegar or, if angry, a coppery odor. For all their developments as a species, calathgars possess a strange connection, even symbiosis, with a far less complex type of growth: brown mold. Notorious for its ability to drain the warmth from an area and freeze the unwary, brown mold not only benefits calathgars-allowing them to grow comfortably in areas they might otherwise find inhospitably warm-but it also pervades the roots and internal structures of the plants. Some suggest that calathgars might be some advanced form of brown mold, yet the idea is typically dismissed, as such mutually beneficial relationships are well documented in the world of mundane flora. As a calathgar grows to maturity, brown mold thrives within its flower and internal structures, aiding in keeping the growth cool and providing it with frigid defensive abilities and a way to spread its seeds-freezing and clinging to creatures that come near before dropping off later. The flowers provide the mold ample places to grow, and defense from creatures that might threaten it. The adult plants also prove so riddled with nutrients upon which the fungus flourishes that should a calathgar violently die amid brown mold, the fungal patch instantly explodes with growth-typically to the detriment of whatever ended the calathgar\\'s life. Habitat & Society Calathgars have little in the way of society, other than grouping together for mutual defense. Despite their intellects, the plants\\' psyches prove distinctive and alien in comparison to those of animals and sentient creatures. They have little interest in emotions, culture, or ambition, yet they possess nearly flawless memories and an understanding of experiences which they can share with other calathgars by scent as easily as (and far more effectively than) humanoids can pass on information by speech. Yet where calathgars do seem most like humanoids is in their capacity to care for their young and seek reprisal should any harm befall them. Should an immature calathgar be trampled, plucked, or otherwise ruined, adults do all they can to pursue and deal vengeance upon those who murdered their young, planting a new generation in the killer\\'s frozen flesh. While calathgars can be reasoned with and most prove generally accepting of honest apologies from those capable of communicating with them, like most enraged parents, an incensed calathgar is rarely in a mood to speak.'},\n",

       "   'description': \"Said to have been formed from an unthinking sliver of steel dashed from Gorum's blade during one of his first clashes with a long-felled god-beast of the Outer Sphere, the First Blade is a living tool of war. Inspired by Gorum's divine bloodlust, this shard of the god of battle's blade continues to obey and do battle in the service of its divine master. Having been reforged through the eons into a manifestation of Gorum's perfect warrior, the First Blade serves as the war god's herald, traveling where its master desires. Yet while the heralds of most deities go forth to bear the word of their divine patrons or answer the most desperate summons of their gods' most pious servants, the First Blade endlessly marches to battle. Never interested in diplomacy or subtlety, Gorum has little need for a messenger other than one capable of communicating in the language of the battlefield. The god of battle answers the calls only of those who please him in battle and request his heralds' aid in epic clashes dedicated to his honor-weakling priests seeking salvation or cowardly revenge never have their entreaties for the herald's presence answered. The appearance of the First Blade changes to match a style of armor impressive to those against whom it will be doing battle, though typically notched as if it has been employed in numerous battles. Rarely seen in the same form twice, its plate mail form might vary from the elegant mail of angelic hosts to slabs of spiked iron over thick bestial hides more common to orc warlords. Whatever the shape, the interior of the armor is never visible. Those who have come close enough to the First Blade and survived claim that only more layers of armor lie beneath its plates, though the hint of something glowing within sometimes spills forth should the herald suffer a rare but occasional wound. Regardless of the specifics of its warlike form, the herald of Gorum typically stands about 15 feet tall and weighs nearly 2 tons. Ecology Although a living creature, the First Blade is little more than a weapon of Gorum, knowing little beyond its lord's command and going only where he wills. Like a golem in many respects, the herald leaves but scant traces upon the lands it passes through between battles, eating little and having no need even to breathe. In war, however, its presence and passage are obvious, marked by rent bodies and blood-soaked earth. Although the First Blade can speak a variety of languages, few of those encountering the herald have heard it do so. Like its master, the First Blade prefers actions-especially violent, purposeful ones-to words. Typically its words are brief refutations of those who have summoned it for an unfit purpose, though several legends tell of the divine messenger offering its respect or the pleasure of its master before striking the final blow upon an opponent who has put up a particularly capable fight or proven her prowess on the field of battle. Habitat & Society While the herald of Gorum answers the call of servants of the lord of battle who seek their lord's intervention in appropriately glorious battle, no accounts exist of the First Blade responding to any summons involving a task other than combat. Most accounts of the herald tell of the gory swaths it cuts through battlefields of heroes, in clashes between titanic armies, or in weeks-long battles between history's greatest warlords. Rumors among Gorum's clergy also suggest that sometimes the herald appears when summoned to a lesser battle, but upon finding a mere skirmish or clash among weaklings, it slaughters all involved. Whether such an end is an honor or a disgrace for those killed remains a subject of some debate among theologians.\"},\n",

While large and imposing, these arachnid-like beings are deceivingly agile, their reflexes fast and movements swift, similar to the darting motions of a hunting insect. Irlgaunts are as quick-witted as they are nimble and have a strong grasp of strategy and tactics. In Iobaria, the beasts are recognized for their eerily patient predations, hiding amid jagged rocks to attack prey and ejecting crippling blasts of rock and digestive acids upon their victims. Irlgaunts typically attack travelers scaling mountain paths with steep cliff sides, using the hazardous terrain to knock unstable hikers to their death, then skittering down the sheer cliff faces to lap up the fleshy pulp below. Most irlgaunts stand between 11 and 13 feet tall and weigh around 3,000 pounds. Ecology Irlgaunts are powerful carnivores that eat most things but seem to have a strong preference for the taste of humanoids and mountain rams, taking special enjoyment in the consumption of bone, horn, and marrow. An irlgaunt's gizzard, located near its upper orifice, is powerful enough to grind rock, creating shards of stone which the creature fires from its mouth.

These gastroliths not only help the creature grind apart the hard substances it digests, but also can be shot forth as weapons, felling and pre-digesting sizable or even flying prey. Gastroliths are under constant pressure within an irlgaunt's body and, once shot forth, prove quite fragile. Upon impacting a victim or any other surface, they shatter in a rain of rock shards and hissing acid. Irlgaunts are found on and around mountains, especially near narrow trails used by travelers, mountain dwellers, or herds of sure-footed animals. The rocky environment they inhabit matches the colors of their bodies, and their uncanny ability to blend into the terrain and attack from unexpected angles makes them skilled ambush hunters. The tough limbs of an irlgaunt end in nimble, muscular tendrils. Along with being able to seek out and cling to nearly imperceptible flaws in stone, these tendrils also secrete a potent, stone-digesting acid much like that found within the beasts' gizzards. This acid allows irlgaunts not only to burn holes into solid stone, but to shape stone into whatever form they desire. Irlgaunts live for up to 300 years and reproduce asexually every half-century. They take special care to protect their offspring for this reason and watch over them for about a year, at which point the adolescent reaches maturity. Habitat & Society Irlgaunts are not particularly social creatures, but they work together when doing so is mutually beneficial. In smaller numbers, irlgaunts are more likely to live in more remote areas, while larger groups may occupy more commonly traveled mountain passes. Irlgaunts sometimes share their habitat with giants native to the region, but do so through an unspoken truce that holds little weight. A single giant walking through an area of several irlgaunts, then, is no safer than a solitary irlgaunt prowling a region populated with giants. Yet neither group goes out of its way to provoke a dangerous feud with its powerful, mountain dwelling neighbors-as long as the other group is generally content to stay out of the way. Treasure means little to irlgaunts, though if they possess a relic or magic item, they use it as bait for sentient wanderers in the region. For this reason, particularly wealthy and well-guarded travelers or merchants may be able to parley with the aberrations, exchanging riches for safe passage. Irlgaunts are largely indifferent to religion. However, some spiritually inclined irlgaunts choose to follow Rovagug, and some even become priests in his name. In such cases, a group or family of irlgaunts tend to worship the same god. Those rare irlgaunts that do worship Rovagug often take an almost personal interest in freeing the imprisoned god, delving deep into the earth and creating new abysses covered in profane images and symbols of the monstrous deity. The hope seems to be that should enough cracks be cut into the depths, Rovagug's prison deep beneath the surface might weaken enough for the god of destruction to break free. The futility of such efforts seems to matter little to the aberrations, which appear to care more about the symbolism of their destructive actions.\"},\n",

At rest, their flat bodies stand roughly 5 inches tall and can stretch out to a wide diameter, their surfaces blossoming into what look like thick tangles of mossy roots and gnarled vegetation as they lie still. Known to emit invisible but dangerous chemicals, these masses of slinking muck cause nearby plants to writhe and coil as if alive, while shocking animals into a temporary but deathly torpor. As such, they rarely must hunt to find food, instead sensing passing creatures and preying upon them after they succumb to the oozes' sleep aura. Always ravenous, the powerful acids that comprise these oozes quickly dissolve the flesh of their meals. A verdurous ooze typically weighs 300 pounds and can easily spread to fill a 5-foot-square area. While moving, such crawling muck rises only a few inches tall, though its structure might grow and boil up to a height of 2 or 3 feet if let undisturbed for a matter of days. Spontaneously grown structures collapse and melt back into the ooze's body as soon as it begins moving again. Ecology Verdurous oozes settle in locations with abundant food, rarely moving far except to feed upon comatose prey that has come too close or to reproduce. Verdurous oozes primarily gain sustenance from the small birds, mammals, and insects that fall prey to their sleep aura, but also prove well suited to devouring larger creatures that fall asleep nearby. Every 2 or 3 years, verdurous oozes collect deep in forests and swamps, clustering in secluded locales tainted by reeking natural compost or the escape of natural gases from the land. As many as 10 oozes might gather during one of these grotesque moots. To reproduce, four verdurous oozes merge to become a greater verdurous ooze. Greater oozes are far more active and hungry than their lesser kin, constantly wandering, feeding, and growing. After several months, the greater verdurous ooze splits into 10 to 15 new verdurous oozes. These new verdurous oozes grow to full size within 6 months. Habitat & Society Verdurous oozes primarily live in temperate forests and plains among high grasses or cultivated crops, though they might also be found in warm plains and jungle environments. As mindless creatures, they pay little attention to others of their kind, save when drawn to reproduce. A notable fact about verdurous oozes is that they beneficially impact nearby plant life; their secretions act as a kind of natural fertilizer. Trees, grass, flowers-all flora benefits from the existence of a nearby verdurous ooze. Over time, this can lead to an increase in the fauna in the area, as they seek to enjoy the rich, lush plants that make up their diet and in turn become prey for the stealthy ooze. Thus, another sign that a verdurous ooze is, or has been, in a particular area is the skeletons of animals that it has consumed, which are left behind once the flesh has been absorbed. Resourceful evil humanoids sometimes take advantage of verdurous oozes' relative lassitude and difficultly escaping from simple pits or other containers, trapping them near the entrances to their lairs. In such instances, the oozes' chemical secretions provide an extra defense for those aware of their presence and the dangers of coming too close. Greater Verdurous Ooze Greater verdurous oozes are formed when several green oozes merge together as part of their reproductive process. They are similar in form but much larger, and while still green, exhibit white and red lines that resemble veins running through them. They are even more voracious and dangerous than standard green oozes, as they eat and eat to gain enough mass to reproduce.

       "   'description': \"Powerful and regal, dweomercats stalk the First World, preying upon lesser creatures, but more voraciously hunting new and ever stranger sources of magic. Beings as much composed of sculpted arcane eddies as of flesh and blood, these capricious felines flourish along the intangible ley lines of their home realm, drinking in its weird powers as a plant thrives on light. Yet even more potent than their thirst for magic and the euphoria they draw from being in proximity to the reshaping of reality is dweomercats' racial curiosity, which leads them endlessly across the First World-and often beyond. The average adult dweomercat is about 4 feet tall and 7 feet long, weighing over 250 pounds, while their cubs are approximately 1 foot tall and weigh no more than 15 pounds. Ecology A newly born dweomercat cub is connected to its homeland by only a thin tether of fey magic, and can only tap into its true potential during the instant a spell is cast upon it. The burst of magical energy brought forth by a freshly cast spell momentarily intensifies the bond between the First World and the dweomercat. This link manifests itself clumsily as a sort of sudden teleportation that heaves the fey cat through space and time toward the source of the spell, fueled by the magnetic reaction between the dweomercat and the magic's origin. A dweomercat grows not by the passage of time, but through direct exposure to fey magic. Thus, a dweomercat cub on the Material Plane is stunted developmentally. Though it ages and gains experience and practical wisdom anywhere, only by spending several lifetimes on the First World can the cub reach adulthood. Once it has reached this stage, however, a fully grown dweomercat may freely travel between its native land and the Material Plane without adverse effects. Habitat & Society In the First World, dweomercats travel in packs while hunting. Beyond this predatory advantage, however, they have little use for organized society, as the evershifting nature of their homeland impedes it anyway. Dweomercats that are born on or come to be stranded on the Material Plane are often forced to live on their own. Cut off from the direct magical eddies of the First World, dweomercat cubs prove unable to grow into adults. While they might become slightly stronger and more learned, they never reach the size and prowess of those constantly subjected to the magic of their homeland. Were a dweomercat cub to return to the First World, it would eventually grow into a normal dweomercat, but only over the course of numerous humanoid lifespans. Those dweomercats marooned on the Material Plane seek out areas of great age, changeability, and magical potency-lands most like the First World. Sometimes this means not a specific place, but rather a period spent journeying with a mortal spellcaster. While an adult dweomercat would scoff at the idea of following a humanoid's orders, adolescents see the benefit of journeying alongside an intelligent creature native to the alien world. Should a dweomercat cub find a magic-user reckless or whimsical enough to keep its attention, it might join the caster as a familiar, gaining a measure of constant magical exposure from the intangible connection inherent in such a mystical relationship.

       "   'description': \"Powerful and regal, dweomercats stalk the First World, preying upon lesser creatures, but more voraciously hunting new and ever stranger sources of magic. Beings as much composed of sculpted arcane eddies as of flesh and blood, these capricious felines flourish along the intangible ley lines of their home realm, drinking in its weird powers as a plant thrives on light. Yet even more potent than their thirst for magic and the euphoria they draw from being in proximity to the reshaping of reality is dweomercats' racial curiosity, which leads them endlessly across the First World-and often beyond. The average adult dweomercat is about 4 feet tall and 7 feet long, weighing over 250 pounds, while their cubs are approximately 1 foot tall and weigh no more than 15 pounds. Ecology A newly born dweomercat cub is connected to its homeland by only a thin tether of fey magic, and can only tap into its true potential during the instant a spell is cast upon it. The burst of magical energy brought forth by a freshly cast spell momentarily intensifies the bond between the First World and the dweomercat. This link manifests itself clumsily as a sort of sudden teleportation that heaves the fey cat through space and time toward the source of the spell, fueled by the magnetic reaction between the dweomercat and the magic's origin. A dweomercat grows not by the passage of time, but through direct exposure to fey magic. Thus, a dweomercat cub on the Material Plane is stunted developmentally. Though it ages and gains experience and practical wisdom anywhere, only by spending several lifetimes on the First World can the cub reach adulthood. Once it has reached this stage, however, a fully grown dweomercat may freely travel between its native land and the Material Plane without adverse effects. Habitat & Society In the First World, dweomercats travel in packs while hunting. Beyond this predatory advantage, however, they have little use for organized society, as the evershifting nature of their homeland impedes it anyway. Dweomercats that are born on or come to be stranded on the Material Plane are often forced to live on their own. Cut off from the direct magical eddies of the First World, dweomercat cubs prove unable to grow into adults. While they might become slightly stronger and more learned, they never reach the size and prowess of those constantly subjected to the magic of their homeland. Were a dweomercat cub to return to the First World, it would eventually grow into a normal dweomercat, but only over the course of numerous humanoid lifespans. Those dweomercats marooned on the Material Plane seek out areas of great age, changeability, and magical potency-lands most like the First World. Sometimes this means not a specific place, but rather a period spent journeying with a mortal spellcaster. While an adult dweomercat would scoff at the idea of following a humanoid's orders, adolescents see the benefit of journeying alongside an intelligent creature native to the alien world. Should a dweomercat cub find a magic-user reckless or whimsical enough to keep its attention, it might join the caster as a familiar, gaining a measure of constant magical exposure from the intangible connection inherent in such a mystical relationship. Dweomercat Cubs as Familiars Attracted to flashy displays of magic and the strange powers inherent in a bond between a magic-user and her familiar, a dweomercat cub that's wandered from the First World might find its taste for magic and adventure satisfied in the service of a particularly whimsical or ostentatious arcane spellcaster.

       "   'appearance': \"A delicate-looking creature floats silently in midair. Resembling a large jellyfish, it has a fringe of bird's feathers around its quivering central mass and long tentacles trailing from its center, with each tentacle ending in a snapping beak. It sings to itself as it flies, each beak making a different note in an eerie harmony.\",\n",
       "   'description': 'Shoals of skrik nettles float through the skies of the First World. They sail like boats, driven before the wind and using their feathers to tack and turn. They sing as they fly, jabbering and chirping to each other in complex harmonies. The average skrik nettle shoal consists of three dozen or more of the majestic creatures, but these flocks are often split up during the roaring storms so common to the First World. Lone skrik nettles may be encountered in smaller numbers, confused and trying to find their way back to their kin. Skrik nettles range in size from a few inches across (for a newly spawned hatchling) to the size of gigantic, scintillating clouds. Most, however, are no more than 8 or 9 feet across. Ecology Skrik nettles are primarily scavengers, although they will attack suitable prey when hungry. Their method of attack is curious. The sharp beaks of a skrik nettle drip with a magical poison that is injected when the creature bites a foe. The victim of the poison feels slightly nauseous and light-headed at first-and then begins to float off the ground. As long as the poison pumps through the veins of the skrik nettle\\'s victim, the victim keeps floating up into the sky. The victim has no control over this magical levitation-unless she has some other method of controlling her flight, such as wings or magic, or she can grab a convenient tree branch, she will keep ascending until the poison wears off and gravity takes hold once more. The skrik nettles usually float up alongside their prey, keeping it floating by injecting more poison as soon as it starts to drop. Especially dangerous or hardshelled prey might be poisoned, allowed to rise, and then dropped repeatedly from a height until dead. The poison\\'s effects seem to be rooted in magic, rather than venom, and dispelling the ailment has proven to be just as effective as bleeding a victim. Before aiding a victim, however, one must take caution to tie said creature down securely, as there are few deaths more ironic than being cured of a skrik nettle\\'s poison only to instantly plunge to earth from a great height. Oddly, in addition to traditional remedies, killing a skrik nettle also instantly cancels the effects of its poison. Once every year, skrik nettles return to their shoal\\'s spawning grounds to reproduce. The jellyfish-like creatures form hard, rugged eggs inside their bodies, then float gently down to the spawning ground-usually a jungle clearing or warm swamp-and dig nests with their tentacles. Skrik nettles are hermaphrodites, so each one lays its eggs and then fertilizes those of its neighbor (this cross-breeding strengthens future generations of skrik nettles). The average skrik nettle lays three or four eggs, whose size ranges from that of a clenched fist to that of a giant\\'s skull. These eggs incubate in the warm earth for several days, during which time the skrik nettles patrol above the spawning ground, attacking anyone who might disturb the eggs. When ready to hatch, the eggs explode out of the ground and shoot into the sky, bursting into a swarm of newborn skrik nettles. Unwary travelers who slip past the patrolling skrik nettles can trigger a premature hatching if they walk over the spawning ground; such travelers may be pummeled by flying, rock-hard egg shards, or even carried into the sky by a particularly large hatchling. Hatchling skrik nettles are ravenously hungry when born. To provide for the needs of their young, skrik nettle shoals assemble caches of poisoned meat and float them over the spawning ground. A wary explorer can spot a spawning ground from afar if she notices rotting corpses hanging overhead. Skrik nettle eggs can often be sold to the fey. Some train young skrik nettles as songbirds, teaching all six beaks to sing in harmony. Others wrap skrik nettle eggs in cloth filled with golden dust or brightly colored pollen; when an egg prepared in such a manner flies into the sky and explodes upon hatching, the cloth\\'s contents scatter across the sky like a beautiful firework. Such entertainments are popular at parties-though the ensuing swarm of carnivorous jellyfish swooping down on the guests is considered less enchanting. Habitat & Society Skrik nettles dwell amid the clouds, descending only to feed and procreate. They use their songs to keep the shoal together, flying toward the chirping music of their kin. Bards are often able to lure skrik nettles down to them with their enchanting melodies, but once within range, the poisonous creatures usually trade this performance for a live meal. Skrik nettles are not especially intelligent predators-thus, they eat the bounty of the land, or, if particularly lucky, snatch a dead or weak creature from the ground. While skittish, they retaliate when attacked, regarding the assault as a chance to feed. Settlements in regions where skrik nettle migrations are common usually keep a few sacrificial animals handy to lure the skrik nettles away during a hunt. The one exception is where the skrik nettle\\'s spawning grounds are involved-during the time before a hatching, the skrik nettle shoal patrols the area around the spawning grounds and viciously attacks any trespassers. Skrik nettles are also a hazard to flyers. They lurk in low-hanging clouds, letting their tendrils trail down out of the mist. An unwary bird or flying creature can be stung, grabbed, and whisked off to be eaten in a matter of seconds. When scavenging, they fly at a low level above the landscape, letting their tendrils play over the ground as they search for carrion. Skrik nettles themselves have few natural predators. They are reputed to taste so light and airy that eating one is like trying to eat a soap bubble, albeit a soap bubble with a half-dozen stinging beaks. Skrik nettles perceive the world by sensing air currents and shifting vibrations through their sensitive tentacles; during storms or strong winds, they secure themselves in the forks of large trees and wait out the harsh weather. Some fey hunt the skrik nettle shoals in little flying boats for sport, bringing them down with weighted nets or leaden harpoons. A few fey even try riding skrik nettles, \"docking\" them to make them harmless by clamping their beaks shut and then hanging a saddle from the tentacles, but the creatures are too weak to make good steeds. It is also the fashion in some regions for noble faerie-maidens to be accompanied by a small flock of \"docked\" skrik nettles, each one bearing a fan, mirror, or basket of fruit in its tentacles. Others capture skrik nettles and train them to speak-the skrik nettles are not intelligent, but they can be taught to imitate the speech of the First World, much like parrots can learn to imitate human tongues. A trained skrik nettle can even hold conversations with itself, with each of its half-dozen tentacles imitating a different voice.'},\n",

       "   'description': \"The bane of fishermen and divers, ningyos lurk in tropical waters, gorging themselves on fish and attacking anything they can sink their tiny fangs into. Nasty little things, these primitive, miniature mer-monsters are bogeymen of the sea, often attacking seagoers, ships, and fishing tackle out of both blind ravenousness and blunt stupidity. With little more organization or society than a school of sharks, these cannibalistic half-simian, half-fish terrors swarm by night and can easily drag those caught on moonlit waters down to drown amid a sea of tiny claws and needling teeth. Yet for all their animal ferocity, ningyos are most notorious for their unquiet deaths. Said by natives to be too mean and stupid to die, a slain ningyo always returns to life by night, obliviously adopting old habits or dragging itself forth from the water to find its killer. By day, though, undead ningyos turn back into normal corpses, sometimes washing up on shore as gruesome and fascinating-but potentially deadly-curiosities. While the knowledgeable burn the eerie corpses they find along the coast, more than one foolhardy beachcomber has collected such an oddity, only to later awake in terror, the tiny withered claws and broken teeth of his weird curio savaging him in the dark. Ningyos measure approximately 2 to 2-1/2 feet long from head to tail, and weigh 6 to 9 pounds. Ningyos on Golarion Ningyos have harassed and terrorized those dwelling along warm coasts for ages, proving most common along the west coast of Garund and the eastern shores of Arcadia. Well informed by the native folklore of those areas, most locals easily avoid and deal with the nasty mer-creatures. Visitors and invaders of such areas, though, are rarely so well informed. The Fetching Fishwife: This saltencrusted beach house-turned-inn teeters on a rocky beach a short ride north of Eleder. Popular with visitors and those seeking to escape the city's roughand-tumble confusion, the Fishwife offers fine rooms, good food, and a collection of eclectic decor-from bestial trophies and wall mountings to native artistry. It also bears a curse. Four guests and two owners have met gruesome deaths in the inn, and the most recent landlord quietly fled Sargava, leaving the keys to the house and a tiny, withered claw to his estranged brother. Kimbal Pall, the current owner, now runs the tavern, having no idea he holds a piece of an undead ningyo lurking in his collection. Treasure at Bloodcove: The treacherous inlets southwest of Bloodcove have long been a favorite stop for Shackles pirates, those with both booty to bury and plots to pillage the Kaava Lands' coastal tribes. Recently, a masked shaman has been sighted wandering between these coves, attended by a large, murderous swarm of ningyos. Although the witch doctor seems to only feed the nasty sea monsters fish heads and bird carcasses, they obey her every command, driving off the curious as they endlessly scour the sea floor, as if for some unknown treasure.\"},\n",

       "   'description': \"Pterosaurs are often found in regions where dinosaurs and other prehistoric creatures are commonly encountered, yet they are not dinosaurs themselves. The pteranodon is the most well known and widespread of these flying reptiles, but numerous other species exist, such as the relatively small rhamphorhynchus, the venomous dimorphodon, and the lumbering, giraffe-sized quetzalcoatlus. While the larger pterosaurs are awkward fliers, the smaller ones can be quite agile and quick. Pterosaurs generally dwell on coastlines, along rivers, or near swamps or lakes, for the majority of their diet consists of fish snatched from the water in daring dives. Pterosaurs are quite territorial, though, and most won't hesitate to swoop down and hiss, shriek, and attack things their size or larger. Rhamphorhynchus This pterosaur is a quick-moving reptile with a 5-foot wingspan, a narrow snout filled with dozens of needle-like teeth, and a long tail tipped with an arrowheadshaped ridge. Males are generally quite brightly colored, displaying brilliant reds, greens, and bright blues, often bearing complex patterns like stripes; females tend to be more drably colored. Although tiny, the rhamphorhynchus is swift and aggressive, and its attack method of swooping down suddenly to attack creatures allows it to bite with increased damage and ferocity. At the end of a sudden swoop, a rhamphorhynchus is typically at a disadvantage, and most won't stick around to keep fighting in melee, instead taking to the air once more to gain enough height to swoop again in a few rounds. Their tiny size, erratic flight patterns, and swift ref lexes make them difficult to affect with area effects. A pterosaur on the ground walks in a quadrupedal gait; the tips of its wings arc up alongside its body, while its lower torso remains closer to the ground than its shoulders and head as it moves. Rhamphorhynchus Familiars Rhamphorhynchuses (also called swoop lizards) make excellent familiars for spellcasters who are looking for a quick and nimble minion. A rhamphorhynchus familiar grants its master all of the typical benefits familiars grant, but their jittery and quick reactions also impart a +2 bonus on the master's Initiative checks. A rhamphorhynchus is generally too small to serve well as an animal companion-if a character wishes to take one as a companion anyway, they have the same statistics as bird animal companions.\"},\n",

Its flesh crawls with worms and seeps with decay, allowing bones and internal organs to slip through hideous tears here and there.

       "   'description': \"The tuyewera is a hideous creation designed to serve not only as a stealthy minion but also as a monstrous assassin. Invisible during the day, a tuyewera can be sent into an enemy's lair to perform any number of missions desired by its creator or master. A tuyewera that lacks a master is a free-willed undead-in wilderness regions, it wanders aimlessly, constantly searching for signs of civilization. If it finds such signs, it invariably seeks out a graveyard and lurks in hiding, waiting for a new body to be buried so that it can burrow into the grave and steal the corpse's tongue at the first opportunity. The tuyewera then stalks the region, looking for mourners of the dead person to lure into a secluded area and suffocate, before stealing their tongues to repeat the process. Variant Tuyeweras The statistics presented on the facing page are for a typical tuyewera created from the body of a Medium humanoid creature, but there are methods by which tuyeweras can be created from the bodies of smaller or larger humanoids as well. While in theory, one should be able to create a tuyewera from a non-humanoid creature, so far necromancers have been unable to achieve this feat. Something to do with the preparation method and the medicines used simply doesn't translate to non-humanoid bodies-although the unique undead created by such methods could have a variety of powers, they are not truly tuyeweras. Guidelines for statting up smaller and larger tuyeweras appear below. Smaller Tuyeweras: Tuyeweras created from the bodies of gnomes, half lings, or even children of larger humanoids can be statted up by applying the young creature simple template. Larger Tuyeweras: A tuyewera created from the body of a giant can be Large or larger. You can simply apply the giant creature simple template, but a better solution in this case is to rebuild the tuyewera with all of the appropriate changes to its stats-whenever a tuyewera's Hit Dice grant it an ability score increase, it increases its Charisma score. A Large tuyewera has 10 HD and is CR 6. A Huge one has 14 HD and is CR 8. A Gargantuan one has 18 HD and is CR 11. The largest, Colossal tuyeweras, have 22 HD and are CR 14. Creating a Tuyeweras A tuyewera can be created via the create undead spell, so long as the caster undertakes a specialized ritual as part of the casting. The body to be transformed into a tuyewera must be that of a humanoid the caster has himself slain at some point in the last 3 days. The spellcaster must be at least 13th level to create a tuyewera. Before the spellcasting begins, the caster must prepare the body by removing the corpse's tongue and severing its legs at the knees. The actual casting of the spell requires the caster to anoint the tuyewera's severed limbs and tongue with special medicines. These discarded body parts must then be burnt to ashes so that when the tuyewera rises from the dead, it does not recognize its missing limbs and tongue (if it does, it immediately attacks its creator). When the spell is complete, the newly created tuyewera is loyal to its creator and follows his spoken commands as long as the caster wears or carries a small pouch containing a handful of the ashes from the tuyewera's burnt limbs and tongue on his person. If the caster ever loses this pouch, the tuyewera becomes uncontrolled. If a tuyewera ever sees the ashes, it immediately recognizes them and seeks out its creator unerringly (as if via locate creature, but with no range limitation) and attempts to kill him-preferably as the creator sleeps.\"},\n",

       "   'description': \"Blood-red man-eaters and cunning jungle stalkers, biloko hunt those who think themselves hunters, preying upon foolish travelers and incautious jungle natives with maniacal zeal. Lanky and quick humanoids, biloko possess exaggerated, fearfully expressive facial features, including mouths capable of stretching impossibly wide. Adept at blending in amid jungle underbrush despite their brilliant coloration, these ferocious jungle fey delight in constructing deadly traps, tricking victims into deadly ambushes, and leading enthralled foes into dangerous situations. The average biloko stands between 3 and 4 feet tall and weighs between 40 and 50 pounds, though a biloko who has recently fed might bear the weight of a far greater creature. Ecology Wild-eyed and unpredictable, biloko are feared by many natives of the jungle and the tropical lands around their verdant hunting grounds. Frequent menaces in both the fireside tales of children and the bravest adults' nightmares, they embody the most common fears of the jungle, proving that beneath the jungle canopy lurk forces that seek to do the unwary harm and can make even experienced warriors disappear without a trace. Biloko exclusively consume humanoid meat, and though they tend to prowl near forest-side villages, prey can be sparse at times. A biloko can live without sustenance for a lengthy period, but the hunger it eventually suffers proves nearly maddening. Sometimes fasting for weeks at a time, the intense hunger pains a biloko feels may drive it to cannibalism, though such occurrences are somewhat rare. A biloko's mouth stretches across its face in a grotesque, unnatural fashion, and it can consume a whole humansized creature in one terrible, hours-long bite, dislocating its jaw like a snake in order to do so. With the aid of its acidic saliva, its powerful maw is capable of grinding flesh and bone into a concentrated, compact form, allowing it to digest and survive off of a single meal for the extended period of time it may be forced to fast while awaiting new prey. If uninterrupted, an eager, starving biloko can swallow an adult human in about 3 hours. Biloko are related to the jungle spriggans known as Eloko, though they are far less organized and more at home in the jungle depths. While wilder and more bloodthirsty than their spriggan kin, biloko possess several similar physical traits, though their gaunt builds and bright red skins make the two unmistakably distinct. Some biloko look on their fey kin as strangely colored relatives, while other biloko attack them just as they would any other stranger. Thus, little special connection exists between the two races. Eloko are further detailed in Pathfinder Campaign Setting: Heart of the Jungle. Habitat & Society Biloko are cruel, mischievous humanoids, known and feared by all who dare live near a forest plagued with the vile beings. Non-locals are urged never to travel alone; those foolish enough to ignore these warnings are seldom seen again. Whether hunting for food or journeying through the wilderness, locals know well to move in groups. While biloko are intelligent beings, their reclusive habits and lust for flesh drive them from any sort of civilized society. They keep mostly to deep, dark areas of the forest, and are rarely seen on the woods' outskirts. Their numbers are small enough that it is rare for two unacquainted biloko to run into each other on a given day, but the species is sufficiently widespread to pose a threat to all travelers. Biloko are not social creatures by nature, but recognize the benefit of traveling in a group. When stealth is not of primary concern, several biloko might band together in order to hunt. While not organized by a tribal system, biloko often identify other biloko long residing in a region as friendly, although they remain cautious when encountering newcomers. They rarely see others of their kind as enemies, but more typically as rivals who begrudgingly allow one another to hunt on the same turf. Biloko rarely deal with other sentient beings-save during a meal. They choose lives of isolation from other races, usually dwelling within dark forests where their fiendish acts are less likely to be noticed by strangers. Large, hollow trees provide shelter for the small humanoids, who drape cloths of moss and ivy across the gaping portals behind which they slumber. A biloko often waits stealthily in his hideout, perched in one position for most of the day as he hungrily anticipates an unwary group of travelers or a lone wanderer. Once such a party or individual has passed, the monster creeps out of his hole, giving his prey a wide berth as he stalks it. At a time he deems appropriate-usually when a traveler is alone or has strayed from the group-the biloko whistles, creating an enchanting melody that draws his target near. The encounter ultimately ends in either the victim's hideous consumption or the biloko's flight. Far from being anchored to his hiding spot, a biloko often leaves his nook to wander the forest in search of other hiding spots on the edges of trails or well-trodden paths. Boring through a stump or the trunk of a tree with his razor-sharp claws, he can create a new abode in the span of several hours. A single biloko can have as many as a dozen hollow tree-holes, which provide valuable landmarks in the often complex jungle-maze he inhabits, as well as safety from pursuing predators or attackers. During his exploratory treks through the thick brush, a biloko might acquire dozens of fruits and berries for their bright colors, carrying the goods back to his nearest hiding hole to gaze upon later. Biloko have little interest in metals and artifacts, though they occasionally stumble upon a particular object they find especially attractive or interesting. They do, however, love gems, as the brightly colored crystals appear dazzling in the creatures' enhanced vision. This sense of sight, which makes anything not green in color stand out magnificently, helps biloko spot prey even in the thickest of jungles, where the skyscraping canopy blots out the sun for miles.\"},\n",

       "   'description': 'Thousands of species of insects make their home within the shelter of the Mwangi Expanse, but few elicit as much dread as the voracious bloodhaze mosquito. Migratory in nature, these ravenous insects amass in great numbers, forming swarms capable of feasting on the blood of humanoids and beasts alike. Perhaps worse, the crimson parasites carry a debilitating disease known for sapping the vitality of its victims. Because of this potent mix of teeming esurience and virulent pestilence, bloodhaze mosquitoes panic almost any community they threaten. Legends describe crimson clouds decimating entire populations on their flight from breeding pool to jungle interior. Only high winds, drought, and torrential rain consistently keep them at bay. Thankfully, the swarms also wax and wane with fluctuations in local prey populations. In combination with the mosquitoes\\' relatively short lifespan, competition for food helps keep their numbers under marginal control. A typical bloodhaze swarm contains more than 10,000 flying mosquitoes. Individually, each mosquito is smaller than a child\\'s fingernail, yet together they form a terrifying assault. Their iridescent wings can refract light, creating a shimmering effect as they move in unison. This effect proves disconcerting to most animals, which wisely flee such clouds, their panic often alerting other jungle inhabitants to the swarm\\'s presence. Ecology Bloodhaze mosquitoes always sate themselves on the blood of other animals, using their darkvision and ability to detect pheromones to track prey. They typically lie in wait near water sources where they can both breed and feed on animals that come to drink. Warm-blooded creatures draw their attention more quickly than amphibians or reptiles, though even lizards, snakes, and frogs become food sources during leaner times. Not only does blood provide sustenance to bloodhaze mosquitoes, but the females actually require it to reach egg-laying maturity. Females must also have water in which to lay their eggs, though even a sewage-filled mud puddle will suffice. A single female mosquito can lay up to 100 eggs, which hatch into larvae after 2 days. Many of these eggs suffer the predation of fish and other aquatic scavengers during this time of vulnerability. The surviving eggs hatch, releasing larvae that molt and shed their skins while feeding on organic matter and microorganisms in the water. Then they enter a pupal stage, conserving energy as they undergo a final transformation before finally emerging as fully grown adults. The entire hatching and growth process takes less than a single week. After reaching maturity, bloodhaze mosquitoes swiftly take to the air, naturally drawn to one another through their pheromones and banding together in swarms strong enough to challenge any animal for territorial supremacy. The life of a typical bloodhaze mosquito spans only 3 months. They spend that time ravenously feeding in their swarms, consuming enough blood that their females can continue laying eggs. The mosquitoes possess no maternal or protective instincts, however, quickly abandoning their progeny before dying out to be replaced by them. Habitat & Society Bloodhaze mosquitoes live in tropical wetlands, only venturing farther away when hunting becomes scarce or high winds carry them into other regions. Unintelligent predators, the mosquitoes give off pheromones to maintain their swarm\\'s cohesion. Specific scent markers for distress, mating, and food rule most of their behavior. Powerful, false odors or thick and pungent smoke can sometimes mask or disrupt this communication, as can immersion in water, leading to traditions among many native peoples of coating themselves in sulphurous mud or burning reeking torches during the height of the mosquitoes\\' feeding seasons. Although bloodhaze mosquitoes don\\'t feed on other insects, they do prove highly territorial. While swarming, a group of the mosquitoes will attack and kill any other insects they encounter. Such ferocity can wipe out whole hives or nests of insectile jungle inhabitants, potentially having farther-reaching ramifications for other creatures speedy or canny enough to escape the swarms. In more dramatic instances, swarms might fell massive jungle insects or the populations of whole areas, leaving trails of crunching insectile corpses to mark their path. Mwangi Menaces Deadly beasts, trackless wildernesses, and violent storms typify most explorers\\' visions of travel through the Mwangi Expanse. Yet however real and deadly such perils may be, they are hardly the only threats travelers through these lands face. Diseases, vermin, parasites, rot, and uncountable other hazards unite in an endless assault against those who intrude upon these wild lands. Maladies like the sleeping sickness carried by bloodhaze mosquito swarms and other insects present just one such danger. While the following details present that disease, GMs who seek to make their tropical travels feel distinct from adventures elsewhere on Golarion should check out Chapter 1 of Pathfinder Campaign Setting: Heart of the Jungle for details on jungle maladies and other threats. Sleeping Sickness Endemic throughout the Sodden Lands and the Mwangi Expanse, the parasitic aff liction known as \"sleeping sickness\" is spread when flying insects inject tiny parasites into their unsuspecting victim\\'s bloodstream, thus inducing fever, headache, joint pain, swelling of glands in the back and neck, and most notably fatigue. The disease gradually infects the brain, causing confusion, reduced coordination, difficulty keeping track of time, and insomnia. While exceedingly dangerous, even when administered by a practiced healer, the best cure for this disease is dosing the patient with the poison arsenic (Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook 558). If the patient survives, there\\'s a cumulative 30% chance per dose that the disease is immediately cured. Sleeping Sickness Type disease (parasite), injury; Save Fortitude DC 14 Onset 1d2 days; Frequency 1/day Effect 1d4 Wis damage and target is fatigued; Cure 2 consecutive saves or arsenic (see text)'},\n",

       "   'description': 'From the time their children are young, Mwangi tribesfolk tell them chilling tales of the savage, childeating chemosit. While most believe these stories hold little truth and serve only to keep children from wandering too far from their villages, others know better. Few who have witnessed the gruesome work of the chemosit survive. Bearing terrible scars, both physical and mental, they recall the creature\\'s utter savagery and inhuman strength. Tribes living in close proximity to chemosits believe them to be the living embodiment of wrathful gods or nature spirits, and pay them grisly sacrifices. In such places, those who suffer the beast\\'s attacks are often blamed for the violence and exiled. In other regions, evil shamans capable of summoning or commanding these beasts gain great power and infamy. It is a common practice for warring tribes to pay such shamans to summon a chemosit to plague the villages of their enemies. Chemosits stand over 9 feet tall on average and weigh upward of 750 pounds. Ecology Chemosits (or Mwangi ape-bears, as northerners sometimes refer to the creatures) are readily identified by their thick and bristly dark-blue fur and broad, stumpy tails. Beneath their fur, coils of muscle stretch across their broad frames, and they move with ferocious confidence. Chemosits can walk upright or run on all fours, and are able climbers. A chemosit\\'s face is a mix of simian and ursine features, with a long lower jaw and the sharp, powerful teeth of a dedicated carnivore. Perhaps its most identifiable characteristic, however, is its terrifying roar. On still nights, its grim echoes roll through the forests, leaving all who hear it sleepless with fright. Strict carnivores, chemosits go through monthly feeding cycles. During the first cycle, they barely eat, often passing the entire month without feeding. During the second cycle, they emerge as voracious predators.Chemosits hunt nocturnally, preferably on dark moonless nights. Able climbers, they often hide in trees, dropping down upon prey from great heights. They favor easy prey, such as cattle, but they consider humans a delicacy and do not hesitate to attack and devour lone travelers or small groups, their favorite morsel being the brain. Feasting upon brains invigorates chemosits, though in varying ways depending on the type of creatures they consume. Some even say that chemosits take on the knowledge and powers of creatures whose brains they ingest, a legend supported by the strange powers or behaviors exhibited by individuals that have recently gorged. Chemosits often stalk villages, entering each night by stealth and stealing away with sleeping victims, preferably children, the infirm, or others too weak to defend themselves. A small number of bold or reckless exotic animal trainers value chemosits for their hunting and tracking abilities. They pay top coin for newborns or cubs, and attempt to raise them in captivity, training them to track down and ferret out prey. A competent handler can typically train them to follow simple commands, particularly instinctive concepts like \"hunt\" and \"kill.\" Most captive-bred chemosits are accomplished trackers. Once they taste fresh blood, however, they eventually turn feral; thus trainers typically attempt to get to targets before their pets. Habitat & Society Chemosits live in Mwangi\\'s most remote and fiercest jungles, where they can find massive boab trees capable of supporting their tremendous weight. They choose regions with large trees near fresh water supplies and, if possible, caves. For the untrained, chemosits\\' territory is difficult to detect. They leave behind few traces of their passing, fastidiously scratching out their tracks and burying their dung. Principally arboreal, chemosits spend the majority of their waking time climbing through the shadowy understory. Caves serve chemosits not as shelters, but as repositories for the remains of their kills. It is unknown why chemosits create such middens, though some suggest they use the scent of carrion to attract prey. Chief ly nocturnal, chemosits retire to the safety and shadows of high trees by day. Once darkness falls, the creature hunts with reckless voraciousness. Chemosits live in small patriarchal clans dominated by an alpha male. Male chemosits are solitary hunters, and establish their clan status through their kills. As they seek out larger game, particularly creatures not found in the deep forest, their hunting grounds often grow to extend beyond the borders of their clan territory. Clan members that display the largest and most impressive kills rise in status and gain access to preferred hunting grounds and mates.'},\n",

       "   'description': 'Gozreh\\'s herald, Personification of Fury, is a living elemental storm of air and water. It may in fact have once been an actual storm given independent life and intelligence, but it does not remember anything before awakening in the service of Gozreh. Its powers allow it to shift itself fully into air or water or even to assume the form of a beast, though it is most comfortable in its dualmaterial elemental shape. Unusual in that it is one of the few elemental creatures serving the Wind and the Waves, Personification of Fury is often courted by the elemental lords to join their ranks as a high-ranking general or advisor on the mortal world, but Fury dislikes the lords\\' squabbling and petty wars among their kind, seeing itself as a perfect example of how in the material realm elements should mix together without jealousy. It remains neutral in the dealings of various planar entities, and with Gozreh\\'s permission it sometimes acts as an intermediary between rival forces-but only in a direct, blunt, and expedient way, for it is a creature of force and action, not gentle diplomacy. Its actions have attracted a small number of sycophants and refugees from the elemental wars, air and water elementals tired of battle and looking for other ways to fill their immortal lives; these creatures follow Fury and allow it to summon them, and in faithful service to it they allow mortals to summon them. When the herald is on the Material Plane and left idle (such as before a battle or while guarding a sacred place), it entertains itself by summoning dozens of Small elemental minions and sending them scurrying about, letting them explore for a few minutes and get into mischief. Though Gozreh is both male and female, alternates genders frequently, and answers to both male and female pronouns, Personification of Fury is genderless, and is easily offended if someone calls it a \"he\" or \"she.\" It also dislikes being called \"the\" Personification of Fury, as if its name were a title; if a speaker doesn\\'t want to use its full name, it expects to be called \"Fury.\" It has a short temper, and has been known to blast even servants of Gozreh with cold or lightning if sufficiently annoyed (though more as a warning than with intent to kill)-those who anger it receive no mercy just because they share the same deific master. It prefers to be conjured during active storms or when such phenomena are nearby; a caster who calls the herald under these circumstances (whether natural or invoked by magic such as control weather) gains a +2 bonus on Diplomacy checks to bargain with it. The creature is also fond of certain monoliths and standing stones used by the church of Gozreh, some of which include large stone faces or roughly anthropomorphic figures. It often flows into such idols, giving them life and speaking as though it were the voice of Gozreh. Having a penchant for dramatics, it might use its control over an object and varied abilities to pose as the deity on a whim or to guide mortals on a desired course. As a living storm, the herald can provide life-sustaining water, whisk others to safety, save mortals from drowning, or rain down watery death upon the enemies of Gozreh. It is comfortable doing any of these things, and has no objection to taking lives-even innocent lives, if this serves the will of Gozreh. Ecology Personification of Fury is an elemental outsider, and does not need to breathe, eat, or sleep. However, it enjoys mixing with the thin air on mountaintops, skimming misty valleys, or tasting the icy waters of the deep ocean. It sometimes forgets its own strength, and may accidentally crush, freeze, or electrocute nearby creatures and objects-its errant bolts of lightning have started many forest fires. It is amoral in this destruction, just as it is in any help it unintentionally provides. Certain magical pools, springs, and streams in the mortal realm may be inadvertent manifestations of its presence, changing the ecology of the region where they appear for hundreds or thousands of years. Habitat & Society Fury has no urge to reproduce or create more of its kind; interacting with its minions and mortal worshipers of Gozreh is the closest it comes to familial interests. On the rare occasions when one of its elementals is permanently slain, it has been known to grieve for years, becoming more withdrawn and prone to outbursts, though its attitude is more that of a creature who has lost a pet than that of someone who has lost a friend or relative. When it finishes grieving, it usually travels to the Plane of Air or Plane of Water, working with the lords there in hopes of finding another like-minded minor elemental minion who may replace the one who was lost. Because the herald can recover from almost any injury as long as a small portion of it remains, some elementals wandering the Material Plane may actually be derived from its substance, cleaved off in some mighty battle and only becoming self-aware after gathering sufficient air or water-though they would not recognize any kinship.'},\n",

       "   'description': 'Spawned from titans who took refuge in the rifts of the Abyss, the Abyss gigas roam the wastes between the oncemighty titan fortresses. These powerful beings do not typically dwell among their own kind, preferring instead to enslave lesser beings-demons and captured planar travelers-and rule over them as despotic tyrants. Many Abyss gigas serve more powerful demon lords in turn. When more than one of the thankfully rare Abyss gigas live near each other, they exist in a state of perpetual warfare, sending forth wave after wave of their minions in battle. In these situations, only rarely do the gigas masters ever face each other and come to blows, and even then never to the death, as they are aware of the fragile existence of their nearly extinct race. When facing other opponents, however, an Abyss gigas is a fearsome foe, battling to the death to prove the superiority of its ancient line. When encountered on the Material Plane, Abyss gigas are fond of taking control of companies of giants and compelling them to do their bidding, feeling at once both a distant kinship and a sense of domineering superiority. Frost giant cults of Kostchtchie are frequent recipients of this sort of attention. Abyss gigas stand over 50 feet tall and weigh 25 tons or more, not including the weight of their Abyss-forged armor and weapons of adamantine. Abyss gigas usually favor the weapons of their demonic patrons.

They normally are only found on the Material plane as a result of being summoned by a cleric (or, less frequently, a wizard) and commanded to perform some task, often being required to use their immense strength to carry objects of aid their summoner. Though an aerial servant performs whatever task is asked of it, it resents being summoned and forced to do the bidding of another; therefore, it attempts to pervert the conditions of the summoning and its mission. An aerial servant that fails or is thwarted in its mission becomes insane and immediately returns to the caster who summoned it, either killing the caster or carrying the caster back to the Elemental Plane of Air with it. Aerial servants are invisible on the Elemental Plane of Air. On other planes, they can be seen, though only vaguely, and appear as humanoids composed of whitish-gray vapor. Sometimes eyes, a nose, and a small mouth appear in the vapor. Aerial servants speak Auran. They understand Common, but do not speak it.'},\n",

       "   'description': \"Hidden within the high canopy overlooking the jungle floor dwells a race of enormous, vicious, and vibrantly colored birds known as camulatz. Possessing a cruel intelligence, camulatz are vile headhunters and aggressive demon-worshipers, preying on all sentient creatures as sacrifices to their chosen demon lord: Pazuzu, King of the Wind Demons. Camulatz revel in trickery and bloodshed, luring victims into ambushes where the camulatz can indulge their bloodlust and take their victims' heads as grisly trophies. The iridescent coloration of a camulatz's feathers assists in mesmerizing unfortunate souls, luring them to the killing ground below the brightly colored bird's aerie. Camulatz also have a special affinity for sounds, naturally mimicking voices and animal noises, while perfecting the magical ability to displace such sounds, making them seem to emanate from other creatures or objects. Camulatz delight in using both their magical ventriloquism and their beautiful plumage to mislead and separate victims before surprising them with diving attacks from above. All camulatz possess sharp talons on their feet, capable of rending the most heavily armored foes, but they rely on their cruelly curved beaks to decapitate their victims. The vivid patterns of a camulatz's feathers also provide some protection to the birds, forming a magical field of clashing colors that can def lect ranged attacks. A mature camulatz is just over 14 feet in length from its beak to the ends of its tail feathers, but weighs only 300 pounds because of its lightweight bone structure. Each individual camulatz bears its own unique feather coloration, which it can consciously manipulate in set patterns to produce its hypnotic display. Ecology Camulatz are carnivores who prefer the raw flesh of intelligent creatures above all else, but they also hunt large jungle mammals, reptiles, and even fish to augment their diet or when their favored prey is particularly scarce. The ferocious birds especially enjoy eating the heads of their victims, whom they decapitate with their razorsharp beaks, preferably while the victim is still alive. Camulatz devour the bodies of their victims without ceremony, but they take the severed heads back to their treetop aeries for ritual feasts, dining on the eyes, ears, tongues, and brains as savored delicacies. Thereafter, camulatz save their victims' skulls as trophies, using them as tribute to Pazuzu, ornamentation for their nests, and markers for the bounds of their territory and favored hunting grounds. While camulatz never forget which individual is responsible for harvesting a given skull, most groups prefer to store their skulls communally, as they believe that their demonic patron finds more appeal in a single titanic collection of skulls than many small individual ones. As such, each aerie has a central altar where skulls are stacked in order of ascending prominence. This location, known as the Place of Screeching, is often used as a meeting place or the location for important rituals, and powerful females may occasionally choose to mate directly upon the altar in the hope that Pazuzu will notice and, in his demonic voyeurism, provide the resulting offspring with fiendish boons. For both genders, however, providing the skull that crowns the altar's tower is a lifelong goal for every individual. Camulatz mate only once a year, or even less, usually with different partners on each occasion. During mating cycles, female camulatz use their hypnotic display ability to lure and seduce their chosen mates, mating frantically and violently with the entranced, nearly helpless males. Afterward, females lay 1-3 eggs, which they jealously guard thereafter-even driving away the fathers-until the eggs hatch in about 3 months. Females communally raise their young for 2 years until the hatchlings reach adulthood, at which point the fully grown camulatz separate according to gender-the males band together to hunt and raid, while the females establish new aeries to maintain and defend. Camulatz have lifespans of 80 to 100 years, and though they have no written histories or oral legends beyond the braggadocio of individual members, their memories are long, and a camulatz never forgets a slight or the face of a prey animal that got away. Habitat & Society Camulatz make their homes in treetop aeries high above the jungle floor, only venturing below their canopy homes when hunting. Male camulatz range the farthest af ield, often spending days or even weeks away from home, building temporary nests on the borders of their territory from which to launch hunting sorties. Meanwhile, female camulatz rule over the larger aeries, safeguarding their eggs and hatchlings. Both genders are equally violent and capable in combat. Camulatz believe they are the chosen followers of Pazuzu, revering the demon prince in all they do. They view the act of decapitation as a holy sacrifice to Pazuzu, and their faith requires them to appease their demon lord by sacrificing a sentient creature at least once per month. Camulatz believe that consuming a creature's head gives them some measure of the victim's power-hence the reason for preying on intelligent creatures rather than simple beasts-and that these ritual feedings attract the favor of their demon lord. Camulatz bear a special hatred for monstrous humanoids and worshipers of Lamashtu, taking up the same battle waged between Pazuzu and the Mother of Monsters. As such, the skulls of gnolls, monkey goblins, and jungle harpies are especially prized by camulatz, and frequently decorate their lairs. Some Mwangi tribes even appease camulatz by offering them such captives in exchange for safe travel through the camulatz's territory or safety from predation, though any deals made with the notoriously fickle bird people are tenuous at best. Many are the tribes who thought to purchase their safety with slaves and sacrifices, only to find their members' own skulls mounted among the sacrifices in the camulatz's Place of Screeching.\"},\n",

       "   'description': \"Tribal totems represent a significant cultural achievement for their adopted tribe. Imbued with a spark of life from the continued worship of those they protect, they stand as lifelong guardians of their villages, defending them against enemies and predators alike. To aid them in this function, they also possess the unusual ability to reshape themselves into the likeness of other creatures, targeting them with eerie pains and ailments. This ability enables their tribe to more actively hunt down such enemies while their quarry is hindered and tracked by the totem. As mindless automatons, tribal totems remain ever dependent on their creators to direct them. Some serve only a defensive role, strategically placed within villages to aid against attacks. Others carry stored messages on their tribe's behalf or vocalize their creator's words. Rarer still are the tribal totems purposed for war, which emerge from the jungle as a potent force capable of spearheading invasions and targeting enemy champions. While most tribal totems are made of wood and combine exaggerated features of folkloric monsters with simple decorations and images of strength (like streaks of blood, the claws of defeated beasts, or enemy skulls), few look exactly alike, as each embodies the deities, fears, or legends of its creator's people. Tribal totems tend to stand 7 feet tall and weigh over 300 pounds. Ecology As constructs, tribal totems have no significant ecological niche. They exist at the whim of their creators and protect their assigned tribes from harm. The divine spark that powers them emanates from the continued adulation and combined spiritual energy of the tribe, but relies upon constant rekindling. Each morning, the totem requires lengthy ritual adoration to renew its power. Otherwise, the totem remains still, appearing to be nothing more than a decorative statue. During elaborate festivals and revels, tribal natives usually spend several hours honoring the totem to ensure it remains vigilant for many days. They also take care to mend and repair any damage it might have suffered on their behalf. Once charged in this manner, the totem may operate remotely for many days at a time, undertaking longer trips on the tribe's behalf to hunt down enemies whose likeness it acquires. Habitat & Society Tribal shamans, oracles, or witchdoctors most commonly undertake the rituals necessary to construct a tribal totem, guiding the rest of the tribe in worshiping and maintaining it. The totem only obeys the commands of its creator or someone appointed by her. In the event of conf licting orders, it always obeys its creator above anyone else loaned such authority. Typically, a tribal totem spends its entire existence within the confines of its creator's village, and is completely dependent on the continuing worship of the tribe to give it a semblance of life. Only in rare cases might a multitude of tribes gather their totems together for some shared offensive. Tales also tell of crazed hermits and shamanic outcasts who have created multiple tribal totems and then set them against specific individuals or whole tribes who garner their ire. Greater Tribal Totems Legends also tell of more advanced versions of tribal totems, some reaching Large or even Huge size. Serving as guardians of important religious or cultural sites, these totems possess multiple faces, one on each side of their heads, enabling them to take on the conjoined likeness of up to four victims at a time. They also gain the following additional abilities: • +3 natural armor • +4 Strength, +2 Wisdom, +2 Charisma • All-Around Vision (Ex) A greater tribal totem gains a +6 bonus on Perception checks and cannot be flanked. • Extended Effigy (Su) A greater tribal totem is no longer dependent on line of sight to affect victims with its shared condition ability. Instead, it can extend this power to any creature that has ever been in its line of sight and is currently within 5 miles, often enabling its creators to inf lict terrible punishments upon their enemies through the totem's connection. Construction A tribal totem is always carved from a single type of wood chosen for its density and beauty-typically, ebony, mahogany, or some other valuable resource whose value is at least 1,000 gp. Some tribes use ivory instead, lashing together the pieces and then relying on the magic of the totem's construction to knit everything into a single whole. Decorations of leafy fronds, stones, animalistic trophies, and paint help complete the appearance. Initially, a creator shapes a totem's features into a ferocious, monstrous image. Then, the application of the proper spells enables the construct to alter its appearance to mimic other creatures.

       "   'description': 'Reclusive and shrouded in mystery, the Umasi-or Harvestmen, as they are known across the Mwangi Expanse-are a race of humanoids who exist between life and death. Unable to heal or procreate naturally, the Umasi extend their lives by transplanting the skin, organs, or even entire appendages of other humanoids onto parts of their own bodies. As a result, there is no typical description for a Harvestman-each is a patchwork conglomeration of different features, though most Umasi have multiple limbs of varying sizes. The need to use body parts of generally the same size and shape makes most Umasi human-sized; few are over 6 feet tall. Most weigh between 150 and 300 pounds, and the constant addition of new flesh has left little distinction between genders. Ecology Zenj legends say the Umasi were an ancient tribe of arrogant scholars who lived deep in the Mwangi Jungle. When a powerful witch doctor came to the Umasi seeking their wisdom, he was rebuffed as being unworthy of receiving the Umasi\\'s knowledge. Enraged, the witch doctor used a taboo ritual to curse the Umasi, stealing away fragments of their very souls and binding them to the flesh of others, forcing them to harvest the bodies of humanoids to sustain a bitterly extended existence. This curse left the Umasi a sterile, aff licted people somewhere between the living and the living dead. Contrary to their appearance, Umasi are living creatures. They eat, breathe, and sleep like other humanoids, but their bodies are in a constant state of decay. This divided nature grants the Harvestmen immunity to disease and resistance to toxins, but even minor injuries don\\'t heal naturally; Umasi must graft new flesh onto existing tissue to heal their wounds. Staving off the endless decay of their bodies requires more extreme measures. As limbs and organs rot, Umasi elders use obsidian blades to remove the subject\\'s decaying parts, replacing them with similar parts from fresh corpses and linking the replacements to the original body through a complex ritual combining ancient Umasi knowledge with the forbidden juju rites of their original curser. When the ritual is complete, the new body part joins perfectly with the Umasi and death is cheated… for a time. In much the same way, Harvestmen are not born, but made. Barren, infertile, and missing pieces of their souls, Umasi are unable to breed. Their only recourse is to tear off chunks of their own flesh, bind them together with the remains of dead humanoids, and animate the results using the same ancient juju rites. Many people have sought the secret to the longevity of the Harvestmen, only to be turned away with little explanation. Because the joining ritual requires one to give away a part of his soul willingly, the Umasi only accept those ready to make such a dire compact because they have no other choice. The Harvestmen only give their \"gift\" to humanoids who find themselves at the edge of death, whether from a grievous wound or some magically resistant aff liction or disease. During the ritual, a piece of the dying humanoid is exchanged with a corresponding piece of an Umasi \"donor.\" Once the stitches are sewn, the dying creature\\'s wounds are healed, and he joins the ranks of the Harvestmen forevermore. Habitat and Society Umasi society is as much a patchwork as its members. Some live off the jungle, hunting and farming as they did before the curse. Other tribes lead sedentary lives, trading ancient artifacts of the first Umasi with explorers in exchange for needed goods. Umasi have no organized leadership or traditional families, and children are unheard of among their kind. Regardless, all Umasi tribes form around a council of elders. While some Umasi still dwell deep in the Mwangi Jungle amid the skeletal ruins of their former kingdom, the majority of the Harvestmen have spread to the Kaava Lands and the Screaming Jungle, distancing themselves from the memory of their curse. Umasi are reclusive wherever they dwell, preferring to stay on the fringes of settlements. Although they need humanoid flesh to survive, most Umasi kill only as a last resort, taking flesh from the newly dead instead. This practice often stigmatizes them further, with other races considering them little more than grave robbers. A few Umasi embrace their near immortality in a darker way, viewing other humanoids as prey. These Harvestmen roam the Bandu Hills with undead ghouls, hunting travelers and harvesting what they wish, sometimes before their victims are even dead. However, some Umasi use their peculiar nature to live harmoniously with other humanoids. Pathfinders tell of human villages where Umasi act as gravediggers during plague outbreaks. Their immunity to disease allows the Harvestmen to safely dispose of infected corpses, while at the same time gaining the flesh they need and also garnering goodwill from those they help. Harvestmen rarely fight with other races, but competition over resources like water or hunting grounds can cause conf lict, and those knowingly trespassing on Umasi land may court their anger. When driven to combat, Umasi are extremely dangerous, laying ambushes for enemies and swarming their targets in the hope of harvesting their strength. With their obsidian blades, Harvestmen can punch through the chest cavities of helpless or dying humanoids to extract vital organs. Any Umasi who consumes these pieces of their victims gains a ferocious surge of power, turning the tide of even a desperate battle. All Harvestmen know the heavy price they pay to cheat death. Some, over the lonely centuries, have come to regret their existence, roaming the lengths of the Mwangi Expanse and beyond in search of powerful magic to free them from their curse. Sadly, no mortal magic has yet proven strong enough to undo the fell curse of the Umasi.'},\n",

Slowly, a supernatural wind begins to swirl about the creature, and crackling sparks erupt from its body. Screeching wildly, it descends as if falling from the sky, its blood-f lecked wings tipped with cruel curved hooks, and its protruding lower beak scalloped with vicious, jagged barbs.',\n",
       "   'description': 'The tribesfolk of southern Garund tell tales of a ruthless winged shapeshifter, a bloodthirsty demon and hunter of men. They call this being impundulu, a name that loosely translates to \"lightning-bird\" after its savage avian form. Legend describes this creature as a huge, stork-like bird that rides upon fierce storms and whose dark feathers crackle with lightning. It is believed that an evil shaman summoned the first impundulu and that using an ancient, taboo ritual, the two formed a blood pact. The shaman offered the impundulu the ability to wear his mortal flesh in exchange for mastery over the demon\\'s significant occult powers. As soon as the impundulu seized control of the shaman\\'s body, it broke the pact-however, the ancient ritual bound the fiend to the mortal form, and even after the shaman perished, it could not shed its flesh. Thus despite its own immortality, the impundulu became forever tied to the realm of mortals. For this reason, it is said, the creature continues to forge pacts with mortal spellcasters in the hope that one day it will unbind the secrets of its cursed existence. Ecology Driven by dark and murderous desires, the impundulu stalks the fringes of the Mwangi\\'s civilized areas, seeking out small villages and well-traveled rivers where prey is plentiful. Most of the time, the fiend hunts in its avian form. A hideous thing of similar appearance to a tremendous stork or vulture, it\\'s readily identified by its distinctive long, jagged beak and its slender wings that each bear a hidden, hooked claw. Despite the creature\\'s intelligence, it behaves barbarically and delights in gory slaughter. It precedes physical attacks by conjuring fierce, wrathful blasts of lightning to confuse and injure prey, then swoops in to rend its prey to pieces. In its humanoid form, the impundulu manifests as a strikingly handsome man with glistening, coal-black skin, whose eyes burn a pale, otherworldly green. His legs end in monstrous raptor\\'s talons, and his black fingernails hang long and curved. Using this form, an impundulu can wander through villages, stalking and seducing women with lies and magic, and preying upon them by draining their blood. The creature rarely uses its humanoid form, reserving it for times it wishes to engage in subtle cruelties. Habitat & Society Impundulus remain unknown outside of Garund, and have adapted to life within its pristine and primal jungles. Usually solitary in regard to their own kind, impundulus are rarely encountered apart from the inf luences of evil spellcasters. The association between witch doctors and impundulus is well known throughout the southern continent. The two often form nefarious pacts that bind the beasts for several generations, and the demons frequently outlive their mortal cohorts, collecting their corrupted souls upon their deaths. Those foolish enough to summon an impundulu soon discover the extent of the creatures\\' guile and violence. Furthermore, many of these wily demons loathe mortals, and turn on their summoners the moment they complete their pacts. Real-World Mythos The impundulu\\'s real-world origins trace back to Xhosa and Zulu tribes of Southern Africa. Tribal folklore describes the beast as a great bird whose wings crackle with lightning. Tales depict it as a shape-shifting vampire able to take the form of a beautiful man in order to seduce its victims. Most consider the impundulu to be an otherworldly demon, though others believe it to be a supernatural creature which hatches from eggs buried in lightning-struck soil. It is oft depicted as the summoned familiar of a powerful witch-man who commands it to plague victims with illness or commit violent, evil acts.'},\n",

       "   'appearance': 'This spectral creature looks like a scarred and shriveled ruin of an ancient tribal elder, with skin caked with dirt and moss, and long white hair tangled with sticks. Sharp teeth fill its cackling mouth, and its eyes are tiny but bright and piercing. Jungle vines weave through its ghostly body, which appears stuffed with decaying leaves and other plant matter.',\n",
       "   'description': 'When a person wise in the lore of the jungle dies and is not buried or given a funeral, the jungle itself may embrace her spirit, creating an obambo (\"forsaken one\"). The embittered spirit seeps into the ground, the roots of plants, and the crawling things beneath, becoming one with the jungle itself. An obambo is cunning, spiteful, and treacherous, but it remembers its old role of teacher and storyteller, a duty and an obligation it both loves and loathes. While dealing with an obambo is dangerous, they are known to assist those in need, if supplicants can meet the obambo\\'s price. Ecology An obambo may rise when a tribal elder or shaman perishes in the wild and is never properly laid to rest. Without the proper rites to lead the spirit into the afterlife, the obambo is lost and sundered from its community and tribe, cursed to wander the wild. If the obambo\\'s place of death can be discovered and its remains returned for proper burial (usually in a small house-like shrine on the land of a blood relative), its spirit is laid to rest forever, but few obambos ever find such peace. Instead, whispered memories drive the obambo to meander endlessly between jungle villages, all vaguely familiar but none ever seeming right. An obambo may be male or female. Obambos are solitary wanderers of the bush and veldt. Animals shy away from them, but obambos share a keen spiritual symbiosis with vermin and plants. Through an obambo\\'s journeys, these are its audience, attending faithfully to the obambo\\'s endless tales and treating it as a wise mentor and leader. Their obeisance, however, can never satisfy the obambo\\'s yearning for the rapt attention of its former humanoid kind to its riddles, stories, and lessons. An obambo is easily angered by the foolish, however, and its stern reproofs often leave its pupils as drooling husks or mindless insectile drones. An obambo\\'s plant or vermin sycophants have been known to devour such hapless wretches, or even to ravage entire villages as they sit enthralled by the obambo\\'s tales. As long as a few survivors remain and learn from the obambo\\'s teaching, it is satisfied. In any case, an angry obambo hardly needs assistance in the act of destruction, as an obambo\\'s spiritual communion with the land enables it to merge itself into the land, rising up as a roaring titan melded of soil, mud, vegetation, and crawling vermin. Habitat and Society Obambos often establish a reputation as darkling oracles, wise and knowledgeable about the jungle, its creatures, and its people. They create small shrines to themselves called akinfa, usually in hollow trees where supplicants may bring gifts and the obambo may sit within. These gifts may be of material wealth, but as a teacher, the obambo prefers gifts that show the talents of the supplicant, be it a crafted item, a song, a story, a riddle, or some other performance. An obambo begins any meeting as unfriendly, but a supplicant may make a Craft or Perform check opposed by the obambo\\'s Appraise skill to offer a gift he has made (offering a magical or masterwork item grants a +2 circumstance bonus on this check). If the supplicant succeeds, the obambo is impressed with his skill and its attitude becomes indifferent. If the check fails, the obambo remains unfriendly, and if failed by 10 or more, the obambo is insulted and becomes hostile. If a creature offers an item the creature did not personally create, the obambo is entitled to a Sense Motive check opposed by the supplicant\\'s Craft or Perform check; if it succeeds, the obambo becomes hostile. An obambo is unaffected by Diplomacy until it receives a suitable gift. An indifferent obambo\\'s attitude may be improved with Diplomacy or by offering additional gifts as above; each gift that pleases the obambo improves its attitude by one step. Using Intimidate against the obambo makes it immediately hostile, as does any unsuccessful Bluff attempt. An obambo can also be challenged to a storytelling contest. The contest is resolved by a Perform (oratory) or Perform (sing) check opposed by the obambo\\'s Perform (oratory) check; if the PC wins, the obambo is truly impressed and immediately becomes helpful. Each time a supplicant tries to inf luence the obambo\\'s attitude beyond indifferent, it responds with a question or riddle, using its Bluff skill or one of its Knowledge skills; the supplicant must oppose the check with the same skill. Each time a supplicant fails this opposed check, the obambo becomes annoyed and all skill checks to inf luence him take a -2 circumstance penalty for 1 hour. An indifferent obambo answers questions in riddles, requiring a Sense Motive check opposed by the obambo\\'s Bluff check for the PC to understand what the creature means. A friendly obambo speaks more plainly, and visitors generally do not need to make opposed checks to determine its meaning. It may offer goodberries to supplicants who have offered it additional gifts. A helpful obambo answers questions clearly, and may also agree to use one of its spell-like abilities to aid the supplicant. However, an obambo expects gratitude and an additional gift after it lends its aid. If no gift is forthcoming, or the supplicant requests another favor, the obambo flies into a rage at the ingratitude and attacks.'},\n",

A bat-like head crowned in brown and black fur darts from side to side. Despite the creature's feral appearance, its eyes peer forward with keen and penetrating intelligence.\",\n",
       "   'description': 'Sabosan (singular and plural) are an intelligent and evil race of bat-like humanoids that dwell in warm and isolated locations. A sabosan\\'s emaciated frame belies a strength and agility not apparent from its gaunt appearance. Its giant, leathery wings can reach a span of almost 20 feet. Both males and females have red or dark brown fur on their heads, necks, chests, and backs. Male and female sabosan stand just under 6 feet and weigh only 150 pounds. Ecology Sabosan are vicious predators, combining human intelligence with a bat\\'s natural adaptations for hunting. They favor warm climates, preferring to make their lairs in places that are inaccessible to most intruders, such as mountaintop crags, abandoned ruins, subterranean caverns near hidden hot springs, and the dense canopy of jungle trees. With wingspans almost three times their height, sabosan are agile and graceful fliers, capable of traveling miles on a single current of air in their dauntless search for prey. Although they can see as well as any human in daylight, sabosan hunt at twilight or after dark when their echolocation-based blindsense ability gives them a great advantage. Sabosan can also use their voices offensively, funneling their screeches into blasts of highpitched sound capable of deafening other creatures. When hunting en masse or attacking foes, a sabosan employs its fell shriek on adversaries while other sabosan use their massive wings to churn up great clouds of dust and debris, rendering foes deaf and blind. Despite such effective hunting and combat techniques, all sabosan appear gaunt and emaciated, as if constantly on the brink of starvation. Cursed with a fast metabolism, they must eat approximately three times as much as a human and supplement their diet with frequent blooddrinking in order to survive. Although they can feed on almost any creatures, sabosan take perverse glee in devouring other intelligent humanoids, seeing the blood of still-living humans or elves as a divine offering to their dead demon lord. Habitat & Society Sages debate the sabosan\\'s origins. Some theorize that they are descendents of humans aff licted with vampirism whose bodies did not succumb to undeath, but still craved blood. Others contend that they were a tribe of humans who yearned for flight and were transformed in a corrupt mockery of their desire by a malevolent trickster god. Whatever their origins, the sabosan were once a great and populous race, living in the massive white-stone city of Jaytirian in the heart of the Mwangi Jungle. Here, the \"dark-wings,\" as they were then called, worshiped the foul demon lord Vyriavaxus and the now forgotten sun god Easivra. When the Gorilla King and his angazhani followers marched on Jaytirian, the sabosan defended their city and drove the high girallons back, but the siege nearly destroyed them. Those that survived were forced to quit their home and spread to the far reaches of the Mwangi Expanse. In the centuries after the abandonment of Jaytirian, the other humanoid races of the Mwangi jungles came to know and fear the sabosan\\'s shriek and thirst. Zenj tribesmen, jungle elves, and even the mysterious Umasi formed hunting parties to stalk and kill the blooddrinkers at the first sign of sabosan in their lands. Today, the sabosan live in small and isolated clans, having been hunted to the very precipice of extinction. Normally such groups consist of up to a dozen members, usually made up of some mated pairs and offspring of varied ages, invariably led by the best male hunter. Most sabosan still revere the demon lord Vyriavaxus, and thus chieftains also act as religious leaders, coordinating their tribe\\'s attacks on other humanoids to appease the sabosan\\'s bloodthirsty deity-usually these \"priests\" have no spellcasting ability, but a few have tapped into a source of arcane power or are granted spells by Zura, demon lord of blood and vampires. If outnumbered or overwhelmed, some clans will band together to defeat mutual enemies, but such alliances are always short-lived, as few regions are capable of supporting the dread hunger of more than one sabosan clan. Females usually have one breeding season per year, and after an 8-month gestation produce a single, flightless pup. Sabosan young achieve full use of their wings relatively quickly but spend the first months of their life clinging to the chest of either parent, where they can experience flight and taste the fresh blood of their parents\\' victims. Children achieve reproductive maturity in just under 10 years, at which time females and males alike take an unrelated clan member as a mate if the clan\\'s territory can support them. Otherwise, the new adults leave the roost and search for smaller clans or-in the case of some males-for territories that can support the creation of a new clan. Upon reaching maturity, some brave-or foolish-sabosan challenge their clan\\'s chieftain for leadership. If the challenge is accepted, the two sabosan engage in a bloody melee, eschewing all weapons to fight with their claws and savage fangs. The Bout of Challenge, as it is known, lasts until death or surrender. Most sabosan choose death above surrender, as losing the Bout of Challenge is to lose Vyriavaxus\\' favor and to no longer be considered a sabosan-and therefore not subject to the taboo against cannibalism. Vampire Sabosan A small number of sabosan leaders have the vampire spawn template, and are easily recognized by their graying hair and red eyes. These undead still thirst for blood like their living kin, but do not need to eat solid food, and thus the rest of a spawn\\'s clan have a slightly better chance at survival. Because of their powers, these spawn usually lead their clans. Due to a quirk of how the vampire corruption interacts with sabosan bodies, most sabosan cannot be made into full vampires, and any attempt just results in a vampire spawn sabosan. Among the sabosan spawn, there is a legend of the \"Night King,\" a true vampire of their kind who is destined to bring together the clans and break the back of the Gorilla King, seizing his lands for the sabosan and using his minions as food and slaves.'},\n",

       "   'description': 'Cruel and spiteful, tikoloshe (singular and plural) are small undead that haunt tropical waterways and jungles, preying on travelers and villagers alike with their magical abilities and appetite for harm. Tikoloshe stand no higher than a gnome or a human child, but their bodies are dense and muscular; many have large potbellies and arms long enough for their knuckles to score the dirt as they walk. Their creation leaves them with blackened, eyeless sockets, but tikoloshe can \"see\" using their giant, bat-like ears. Their skin is smooth and shines whether wet or dry. Tikoloshe are genderless; they stand about 4 feet tall and weigh almost 150 pounds. Ecology Tikoloshe are created from the corpses of the dead, but are not mindless like some zombies or skeletons. Creating a tikoloshe requires a ritual wherein a spellcaster places a newly dead humanoid body in a specially crafted clay basin of shallow water and then bores a hole through the corpse\\'s eyes with a red-hot poker. As the creator casts magical fire through this aperture, the surrounding water is rapidly drawn into the body. As it does, the corpse shrinks and changes, casting off all vestiges of its former features and replacing them with those of all tikoloshe. The conf licting forces of fire and water animate the tikoloshe and instill it with its well-known hostility. The tikoloshe\\'s creator can exact one service from its new creation, but afterward has no control over the creature. A tikoloshe\\'s undead traits and resistance to fire make it an ideal servant for many tasks. Some are forced to mine rare minerals deep underwater or to capture exotic elemental creatures on fiery planes. Other creators use tikoloshe as sinister pawns to curse or even kill hated adversaries. Once released from servitude, tikoloshe prefer to inhabit waterways and shallow seabeds where they can rest undisturbed and where they can surprise travelers, fisherfolk, and swimmers. When partially submerged, a tikoloshe\\'s body merges with the surrounding water, making it difficult to see and battle. When not near water, tikoloshe dwell in shallow holes under rocks and large trees, and even under porches and raised buildings in small villages. While their bodies do not require food to sustain themselves, tikoloshe enjoy stalking and eating smaller creatures like birds, frogs, and rabbits. They particularly relish killing monkeys, as they enjoy the nearly human screams the unfortunate animals make. Tikoloshe will sometimes make ghastly fetishes of their kills and leave them on the fences or doorsteps of local settlements to hint at their presence and cause fear among those they seek to torment. As a result, many jungle tribes place rare or semiprecious stones on the thresholds of their homes as an offering for tikoloshe to eat, claiming that doing so protects that home against the creature\\'s wrath. Although some scholars dismiss such practices as abject superstition, druids and clerics of the Mwangi Expanse assert that by ingesting a potent fragment of earth, tikoloshe are able to soothe the opposing elemental forces within them and thus still their malevolent nature. Habitat & Society Tikoloshe form gangs and clans whenever possible, knowing that their ability to cause mayhem is greater in numbers. Individually, they haunt inhabited areas using their invisibility to cause strange, uncanny incidents like unlocking doors to animal pens, moving and breaking household objects, and spoiling food. Tikoloshe often use their curse to bestow bad luck on those that they haunt. Watching from their invisible perches, from beneath beds, and even from inside closets and cupboards, the tikoloshe take spiteful glee in observing those whom they have rendered suddenly clumsy, weak, or otherwise inept as they fumble even the simplest of tasks. Many tikoloshe use their powers for more than mischief, however, and can prove a serious threat to both residents and travelers of the Mwangi Expanse. When fighting as a pack or clan, tikoloshe use their rapid swimming to close with foes, quickly swarming a single target and dragging it underwater. On land, groups of tikoloshe use invisibility to get close to opponents, seeking to curse as many enemies as possible before losing the element of surprise. They are cunning enough to use physically debilitating curses on heavily armed folk and mind-harming curses on those who they think might be spellcasters. Individual tikoloshe always try to flee when faced with organized resistance. If tracked or cornered, tikoloshe plead for their lives by offering a service to their captors, usually the same one that was exacted from them upon their creation. Those who accept a tikoloshe\\'s offer may indeed benefit from the creature\\'s service, but they must also be very cautious, as tikoloshe are not bound by any promises they make once their original commitment to their creator has been fulfilled. Cunning tikoloshe are known to barter their services for their lives, but only to buy enough time for their new masters to turn their backs. Variant Tikoloshe Depending on the ritual used and the quality of the materials, some tikoloshe look different than the standard dwarf-gremlin variety. Some look like horrid Small werebears in hybrid form, or like a worm-like creature with a dog\\'s head and golden tongue. These variants may or may not have the burned-out eyeholes of the \"standard\" tikoloshe. Creating Tikoloshe The process of creating a tikoloshe is more complex than for animating most undead creatures, but requires the same fundamental magic. Ultimately, the creation process culminates in the casting of the spell create undead. In addition to the normal components of the spell, creating a tikoloshe requires the equipment and process previously noted, adding 1 day of effort and 100 gold pieces to the typical requirements of the spell. Typically, a caster loses control over a tikoloshe after the undead performs one service for him, though creators of level 15 or higher retain control. Tikoloshe in Mythology The tikoloshe is an evil zombie or water spirit depicted as a trickster in tales throughout Southern Africa. Able to hurl curses and turn invisible by swallowing pebbles, tikoloshe are described as playing all manner of poltergeist-like tricks on people, although some tales depict them assaulting sleeping women or biting off toes during the night, giving the creatures a more sinister quality. Descriptions of the tikoloshe vary from myth to myth, but most emphasize its gremlin-like features, small stature, and the burned-out holes where its eyes should be. Cultural historians claim that the latter links the creature definitively to Zulu mythology because of the importance of fire in most Zulu legends. To this day, the tikoloshe is synonymous with misfortune, and the creature\\'s name is invoked whenever a person suffers bad luck.'},\n",

       "   'description': \"Rune guardians are animated constructs from ancient Thassilon, created by the runelords to guard laboratories, ossuaries, and repositories of lore. Each rune guardian is dedicated to one of the seven rewards of rule (now known as the seven sins of the soul), and empowered with that sin's associated school of magic. As such, there are seven varieties of rune guardian, each recognizable by its shape-that of the Thassilonian rune representing that specific sin and arcane school. (The Thassilonians did not consider divination a separate school). Unlike golems, rune guardians are intelligent, able to follow complex orders and pursue intruders. They were built to coordinate with other servants of the runelords-for example, an envy guardian's hold portal ability is more dangerous when used to lock someone in a room with a servitor monster. A rune guardian is approximately 1 foot in diameter and weighs around 10 pounds. Variant Rune Guardians The statistics presented above represent only the least specimen created by the ancient runelords, with the power of a single 1st-level spell. Other variants exist, with different spell-like abilities or ones of increasing magical power. Rune guardians are always tied to one school of magic, and all of a rune guardian's spelllike abilities must come from that school. For example, a rune guardian of wrath might cast magic missile or shocking grasp instead of burning hands. In addition to the spell-like ability listed above, more powerful rune guardians of gluttony might possess the ability to cast blindness/deafness or ray of exhaustion. Construction A rune guardian's body is carved from a single block of semiprecious stone, then polished and treated with rare dusts and oils worth at least 500 gp. Rune Guardian CL 11th; Price 6,500 gp Construction Requirements Craft Construct, fly, geas/quest, plus burning hands, color spray, hold portal, ray of enfeeblement, reduce person, sleep, or summon monster I, creator must be caster level 11th; Skill Craft (stonecarving) DC 16; Cost 3,500 gp\"},\n",

Suddenly, with a hideous retching and tearing sound, the man's face blooms out like a rotten flower and a pallid, five-jawed worm extrudes itself from the ragged hole in the neck where, only a moment before, a head sat.\",\n",
       "   'description': 'The hideous vermlek demon is one of the lower-ranking members of the demon race, barely above the dretch in power but remarkably more ambitious and intelligent than its pudgy lesser kin. They wriggle and crawl in nauseating numbers in many Abyssal battlefields or graveyards, impatiently awaiting a chance to find a humanoid body to inhabit. Outside of a host body, a vermlek appears like a fatheaded worm with four long tails, each of which ends in a wriggling nest of long filaments. In this form, the vermlek cannot wield weapons, and its bite and spell-like abilities are its only offensive options. A typical vermlek is 7 feet long (with its filaments giving it a further 3 feet of length) and weighs 90 pounds. Ecology Vermleks form from the souls of those who habitually violated the dead in life, such as graverobbers, necromancers, and necrophiles. On the Abyss, the vermleks are countless in number. A single sinful soul can spawn dozens if not hundreds of these demons in much the same way that the body the soul leaves behind spawns maggots. A newly formed vermlek can flop and writhe through the stinking Abyssal necropolises and swamps and boneyards for eons before it finds a body to inhabit, but it\\'s much more common for a vermlek to be \"harvested\" by a more powerful demon for use in a battle. Vermleks harvested in this manner are carried in huge steel cages on the backs of enormous fiendish beasts of burden, such as retrievers, and either sold to powerful Material Plane spellcasters or used in battle against humanoid foes. The classic use for vermleks in such cases is to open the cages containing the worm demons after an initial skirmish or battle so that they can slither out onto the battlefield and claim bodies from the dead, thus recycling the carrion for use in the next battle to come. As vermleks can only inhabit the bodies of humanoids, this tactic isn\\'t as common on the Abyss (where demons typically fight themselves or other outsiders), but in regions of Golarion where demons hold sway, such as the Worldwound or Tanglebriar, their use can be a particularly demoralizing form of psychological combat. The process by which a vermlek inhabits and controls a dead humanoid is partially biological, partially necromantic. A vermlek\\'s body is boneless and exceptionally elastic-it can wriggle into a body through the mouth, a wound, or any other opening in less than a minute, eating the bones and organs within with noisy rapidity. It then settles into the cavity thus created, extending its four tails down into the torso and eventually into the hollowed arms and legs of its host, whereupon the filaments at the tips of these tails weave through nerves and muscle like a puppet\\'s strings. The vermlek can immediately use the body to move about, wield weapons, speak, and otherwise interact with society. The creature can control the coiling and wriggling of its body to keep its host appearing humanoid, but it can do little about the size of its body-humanoids inhabited by a vermlek always look hideously obese. Worse, the host body, which remains dead, rots normally-a vermlek that does not maintain its body\\'s freshness with gentle repose must abandon the rotting flesh 7 days after inhabiting it to seek out a new host. Vermleks know that a keen eye that peers into the mouth of a host can quickly undo their deceptions, and as a result they tend to mutter or mumble when speaking to keep from opening their mouths too wide. Many use veils, helms, or scarves to hide their mouths. When confronted in combat, though, a vermlek in a host body quickly abandons its disguise, extending its hideous worm head out through the host\\'s mouth to give itself a secondary bite attack-doing so ruins the host body for further disguise purposes. Habitat & Society Vermleks can often be found at the sites of vast battlefields on the Abyss where wars with humanoids (fiendish, celestial, or otherwise) have occurred. These sites are particularly common on Kurnugia, where the fiendish gnolls of Lamashtu constantly bicker and war with one another, and on Ishiar, where the fiendish human pirates and scoundrels that dwell upon that ocean\\'s islands wage eternal war. These demons generally spawn in Abyssal realms like Everglut, Uligor, and the Spiral Path, where demon lords associated with the dead or worms rule, and they can be found in great number in those regions\\' vast graveyards and necropolises. Although they are often used as disposable infantry in mass battles, vermleks themselves have little taste for such activities and, left to their own desires, prefer to live in hiding among humanoids on the Material Plane if they can find their way into that realm. A vermlek fortunate enough to find itself on the Material Plane enjoys disguising itself as a laborer, gravedigger, dungsweeper, or any other lowclass role in which it can blend in while still having access to the city\\'s dead. A vermlek\\'s ghoulish and taboo lusts are only magnified by its creation, and on the Material Plane, the arrival of one of these filthy demons in a society almost always presages a sudden upswing in scandalously violent or distasteful crime.'},\n",

       "   'description': 'Although brimorak demons are generally limited to regions of the Abyss where fire and smoke hold sway, in those regions they are vast in number. Demon lords like Flauros use brimoraks as the primary infantry troops in Abyssal armies-although their command of fire makes them less effective against most fiends, they are particularly devastating against many other foes. Brimoraks are small in stature, rarely standing over 3 feet in height, yet surprisingly strong for their size. Those who underestimate these demons often don\\'t live to learn of their errors, for brimoraks are quick to press the advantage against larger enemies after softening them up with fire magic. A brimorak\\'s dense musculature and bones result in unexpected weight as well-one of these creatures usually weighs nearly 200 pounds. Ecology Brimoraks form from the souls of arsonists and those who used fire in life to torture and kill innocent victims-especially witches, heretics, and other such \"criminals\"-via burning at the stake or on a pyre. Although a brimorak is not damaged by fire, it still feels the pain of fire as long as it lives-the boiling of its own blood is a constant reminder of its sins from a previous life. This state of constant pain is alleviated somewhat after a brimorak uses one of its fire-based spell-like abilities or its breath weapon-while this has no game effect on the demon, the temporary relief does encourage it to use its magic and breath weapon as often as possible in combat. Many brimoraks become masochistic creatures as a result of the constant pain. In combat they often display little to no regard for their personal safety, provoking attacks of opportunity or ignoring obvious foes for the chance to hurt a helpless foe. Yet this disregard for safety doesn\\'t descend into truly self-destructive behavior-a brimorak with fewer than half its hit points becomes suddenly more careful about its actions. Unlike most demons, who can teleport at will, brimoraks can only use this powerful spell-like ability once per day, and they generally rely upon it to get themselves out of peril rather than to ambush foes. Habitat & Society On the Abyss, brimoraks usually serve more powerful demons as taskmasters, thugs, or soldiers. These brimorak demons know little more than battle, and when not fighting together against a foe they tend to fight each other in an endless conf lict for superiority. On the Material Plane, however, brimoraks take on a much more authoritative role. While most are called via spells like lesser planar ally or lesser planar binding in order to serve mortal spellcasters as minions, now and then a brimorak escapes control and can remain on Golarion. Freed from demonic overlords and binding spellcasters, a brimorak loose on the Material Plane understands that it is viewed as a monster and reacts intelligently-it does not immediately revert to an orgy of arson and destruction, but instead retreats into hiding. Free brimoraks prefer to lurk in rundown slums in large cities, in catacombs or sewers, or in remote wilderness regions. Typically, a lone brimorak seeks out a tribe of savage humanoids like goblins, orcs, gnolls, or barbarians and establishes itself as the dominant force for the tribe by killing its leader and several of the tribe\\'s more powerful members-whatever it takes to get the tribe\\'s survivors to bow down before the demon. As a result, the majority of brimoraks encountered on the Material Plane are encountered as lone creatures serving as the leaders of tribes of fecund and aggressive humanoids. Often, and particularly in the case of tribes of superstitious humanoids, the brimorak is regarded as both a chieftain and a god, with tribal adepts actually worshiping the demon out of a mixture of fear and ignorance. Of course, the brimorak is only too pleased to perpetuate such beliefs by requiring frequent sacrifices, using its defensive abilities and spell-like abilities to perform \"miracles,\" and periodically punishing its followers for real or imagined transgressions. Eventually, the brimorak has the tribe so cowed and under his control that he can finally turn to the joys of mayhem by ordering the tribe to take up ill-advised crusades against neighboring tribes or settlements. The brimorak continues to order these attacks on nearby victims until his tribe is destroyed or high-powered opponents arrive to stop it. Brimoraks who are finally confronted by foes capable of defeating them generally don\\'t stay around to defend their followers, but instead simply teleport to some other region, whereupon they begin the process anew by seeking a new tribe of doomed savages to rule.'},\n",

       "   'description': \"Statuesque and hauntingly beautiful (at least, until the toothy wounds on their arms gape open), seraptis demons are the favored minions of the demon lord Sif kesh, although they also often serve other demon lords (particularly Nocticula and Socothbenoth). Formidable combatants, seraptis demons typically function as bodyguards or lone champions for their masters, but many of these demons have achieved greater glory on their own as rulers of subdomains in greater Abyssal realms. A seraptis demon stands 7 feet tall and weighs 230 pounds. Ecology Seraptis demons form from the souls of those who, in the act of committing suicide, caused an unusual amount of despair, destruction, or mayhem. A quiet death in a dark room might result in the soul becoming a seraptis if the victim was a wellknown and beloved political figure whose suicide compelled his followers to riot and murder. A plunge from a high tower into a crowded marketplace might result in a small amount of collateral damage if the jumper lands atop a passerby, but this would not normally doom the suicide to existence as a seraptis. Suicide by detonating a necklace of fireballs in the middle of a wedding, on the other hand, would likely result in the dead soul becoming a seraptis. With one exception, those who deliberately commit suicide in an attempt to have their souls transform into seraptis demons instead find themselves manifesting upon the Abyss as larvae-the Abyss does not reward deliberate suicide with such power as a seraptis wields. The one exception is in the case of a powerful worshiper of the demon lord Sif kesh. The ritual by which such a worshiper can transcend mortal life and transform into a seraptis is one of the cult's most closely guarded secrets, and one that is only revealed to the most heretical and deviant of the faithful. Seraptis demons formed in this manner always retain their previous life's personality and memories, although they lose all class-based abilities in the transition. Habitat & Society Although the seraptis champions and assassins who serve Sif kesh and other demon lords are well feared, the true terrors of their kind are those who have broken free from servitude to more powerful demons and, in so doing, have established themselves as ruling forces. Known collectively as the Dolorous Sisters, these demons are all advanced serapti with several class levels, ranging from CR 19 to CR 22. These seraptis demons are all ex-worshipers of Sif kesh who have undergone the secret suicide ritual to transform into demons, but in true heretical style, they no longer directly serve the Sacred Whore. None have yet ascended to the vaunted rank of nascent demon lord, for the Dolorous Sisters hope to someday transcend as a group into a full-f ledged demon lord by undertaking a hideous suicide pact, bypassing the convoluted and dangerous step of nascence most demon lords must endure. In true Abyssal form, though, the Dolorous Sisters have long been plagued by internal bickering, treachery, and clandestine assassinations. They require 23 members before they can even begin their suicide ritual, and while the sisters' numbers have grown steadily (if slowly) since their initial formation eons ago, they have yet to reach that key number. The Dolorous Sisters do not dwell together-rather, they keep palaces built upon different themes that match their own favored methods of suicide scattered throughout the Abyssal cities of Diovengia, Vantian, and Yanaron, as well as various cities located on remote Midnight Isles. Portals sometimes connect some of these palaces as alliances grow between the demons, yet the constant threat of betrayal ensures that these portals remain among the most heavily guarded parts of each domicile.\"},\n",

The creature's head-part dragon, part saurian, part demon-is a nightmare of horns and fangs and cruel, glowing eyes.\",\n",
       "   'description': 'Vavakias are immense demons of great power. Saurian in shape, appetite, and destructive power, they are most often encountered on the Material Plane not as demons conjured by spellcasters to serve, but as violent invaders come to the world through tears in reality or portals to the deeper rifts. On the Material Plane, a single vavakia is a formidable presence, for the strange demons are driven to feed on living souls and spread destruction-roles they were built to excel at. A vavakia demon measures 30 feet in length and stands 15 feet tall, weighing in at 6,000 pounds. Vavakias form on the Abyss from particularly cruel mortal souls who, in life, practiced the vile act of extracting, enslaving, and even consuming other souls. When such a sinful creature arrives on the Abyss, it brings with it partially absorbed fragments of souls from its victims, resulting in a horrific transformation into one of the Abyss\\'s most dangerous forms of demonic life. Ecology The first vavakias were created eons ago by Lamashtu, who was unsatisfied with the raw physical might and monstrous shape of many of her earliest demonic minions. In those early days, before she had become a deity, Lamashtu was already quite interested in the method by which the Abyss transformed the souls of sinful mortals into demons. When she learned that this process had first been triggered by the daemons, she was at once intrigued and enraged-intrigued because she knew that anything the Horsemen of the Apocalypse could do, she could do, and enraged at the idea that she owed her very existence to the curiosity of a daemonic lord. Of course, Lamashtu herself rose from the Abyss spontaneously, shortly after the daemons first \"taught\" the Abyss how to process sinful souls, but that difference meant little to the Mother of Monsters. Fueled by this rage, she waged war against Abaddon for many years and captured two Horsemen of the Apocalypse-predecessors of those who hold those titles now. She murdered one of them, and forced from the other the secret method of manipulating souls and the Abyss before murdering him as well. Both murdered Horsemen were soon replaced on Abaddon, but by that point Lamashtu\\'s wrath had been spent and all that remained was her own curiosity. Most of Lamashtu\\'s earliest attempts to create demonic life were hideous failures, but even in these failures Lamashtu found joy and delight. It wasn\\'t until the demon used her own body as an incubator to shape and then eventually birth the first vavakias that she had her first real success. Lamashtu\\'s early work in creating and manipulating the Abyss in this manner may have much to do with her resulting rise in power to the position of Queen of Demons-had not her escalating war with Pazuzu forced her attentions away from this hideous form of \"art,\" there\\'s no telling what other strange demonic races she might have birthed upon the world. Now that she is a true goddess, Lamashtu\\'s interests expand far beyond the \"curiosities\" of the Abyss, and she has little time or desire to wallow in her home plane\\'s fecund properties. Of course, other demon lords throughout the Abyss are eager to learn these secrets, but to date, none have managed to duplicate Lamashtu\\'s feats of creation. In any event, the vavakias themselves have proven a phenomenal success, and are among the Abyss\\'s most dangerous demonic races today. Habitat & Society Although they were originally created to serve as powerful, living weapons of war, the vavakias have long since established their own presence on the Abyss as warlords and conquerors. While some pledge their service to powerful demon lords, most vavakias rule small empires of their own in the Abyss, typically in remote corners infested with swamps, jungles, and other primeval terrains.'},\n",

The thick, oily plumage covering its body all but conceals these tiny wings. An adult achaierai weighs roughly 750 pounds. Though not devils themselves, achaierais live and hunt on the scorched and blasted plains of Hell, where they make excellent use of their long, stilt-like legs in running down any lost souls or lesser devils who stumble into their feeding grounds. Once it has closed with its target, an achaierai attacks with its two front legs, punching or slashing, as well as biting with its powerful beak. Far smarter than their animalistic form might suggest, achaierais prefer to hunt in shrieking packs and use their prey\\'s confusion and their own reach to their advantage, circling their quarry and darting in to attack as soon as the victim becomes distracted, then retreating again before the prey has a chance to retaliate. They have been known to wander through battlefields in the lower planes, picking over dying and regenerating creatures and souls, which has earned them the nickname \"Hell\\'s vultures.\" As achaierais are immune to the toxic clouds of others of their kind, they often work in conjunction to use these clouds to herd or scatter enemies, form long lines of black clouds to protect their retreat, or merely panic opponents in large melees. Achaierais are fond of disemboweling their targets and feasting on the hot entrails while their mortally wounded prey screams itself to death. Of course, as outsiders, achaierais have no need to eat, and their elaborate hunting routines are simply the bird-beasts\\' sick form of entertainment.'},\n",

They also understand the profound inf luence living things have on the cosmos, and if left untended, its ability to create terrible consequences. In this circumstance, life must give way to death. Akhanas wander the byways of the multiverse, constantly on the hunt for imbalances in life. How they judge these imbalances is not well-understood by non-aeons, and the aeons are singularly unmotivated to justify akhanas' decisions when inquired about them. As a result, the focus of akhanas' attacks and attentions usually seems arbitrary or even random to most creatures-they do not always focus their attentions on the strongest or the weakest members of a group. An akhana stands 5 feet in height and weighs 120 pounds. Its strange central body seems vaporous, but is weirdly solid (and slimy) to the touch.\"},\n",

Far more often, though, bythos seek out abuses of planar travel, such as tears in reality, regions where planes overlap, or creatures that abuse the use of planar travel. In some cases, such distortions are ignored, but in others, a bythos or even a full tribunal comes to assess and repair the damage. In most cases, \"repair\" is analogous to the death of the creature responsible for the distortions, but placing such creatures in temporal stasis can also solve the problem.

       "   'description': \"While mortals possess the gift of free will, both logic and emotion inf luence their decisions. The paracletus serve the aeons as agents who connect with mortals and study the inf luence of emotions (particularly the dualistic nature of raw emotion) upon mortal behavior. They wander the planes seeking mortals with particularly strong emotional or logical capabilities (characters with high Charisma or Intelligence scores). Once a paracletus locates such a creature, the paracletus remains nearby, studying the target's relationship with emotional and logical input and choices. Often, the paracletus will use its emotion aura on the target in order to study how outside inf luences affect the subject. Unfortunately for the target creature, whether or not the paracletus uses a helpful or harmful effect is, for all intents and purposes, a matter of random chance-even though to the paracletus's complex reasoning, nothing is left to actual random chance. If presented the option, a paracletus avoids direct combat, and uses its emotion aura to inf luence situations. If pressed to defend itself, it flies at opponents, slamming into them and discharging an electrical jolt of energy in addition to buffeting with its crystalline components. The crystals that orbit a paracletus are solidified aspects of logic, while the swirling vapors and lights that make up its central mass are manifestations of raw emotion-when a paracletus is slain, both the crystals and vapors fade away into nothingness. A paracletus can be chosen as a familiar by a 7th-level neutral spellcaster who has the Improved Familiar feat. A paracletus familiar does not abandon its mission to observe emotions and logic at play, but it does follow its master's orders-this is one situation where the application of a paracletus's emotion aura need not be random. Although the central mass of a paracletus's body appears to be made of light and energy, it is in fact solid, and feels strangely like electrified flesh to the touch.\"},\n",

       "   'description': 'The pleroma is the most powerful of all the aeons. As a manifestation of the opposing acts of creation and destruction, a pleroma exists in a state of flux, its very form shifting between creation and oblivion within the ebon folds of its vaporous cloak. One who gazes upon a pleroma could spend days studying the continual changes of its form, which most resemble the shifting of celestial bodies within the universe sped up to a pace at which the swirling of galaxies and the tumble of planets form a strange dance. Pleromas view the concepts of creation and oblivion not so much as separate processes, but rather as two parts of a cyclical passage that everything in existence must explore. Pleromas guide this progression, ensuring everything remains balanced, such that whatever is created can be destroyed, and that nothing becomes so static that these two processes slow to a halt. For everything that attains a state of semi-permanence, there must be many more things that do not, or rather that cannot ever be reformed into a state of permanence. While pleromas believe in eternity, they understand that eternity is cyclical and infinity is something that repeats itself. Therefore, eternity and infinity are states that can be changed, or altered, if only slightly. Pleromas maintain such changes are necessary to keep the cosmos from becoming static and unbalanced, a state they refer to as apocalypse, or the end of everything. Of all the aeons, pleromas possess the strongest connection to the entity or concept they refer to as Monad. All aeons believe themselves to be extensions of this entity, and while they act freely and independently of the entity, they always act within the constricts of its will or needs. This behavior is not so much a state of servitude as a symbiosis in which the actions of the pleromas are universally beneficial to both themselves and the entity they are part of. Pleromas describe Monad as the sentience of the multiverse, from which all things are created through the recycling of everything that ever existed. Pleromas typically travel alone. Their arrival in a region almost always heralds some sort of dramatic change. They pay little mind to the wants and needs of other creatures, and remain entirely focused upon their primary task. They avoid conf licts of ethics, wars, and similar pursuits, save when manipulating such events would help to restore the balance between creation and oblivion. Should any be so foolish as to attempt to interfere with or sway their work, pleromas immediately retaliate by bringing all of their significant powers and devastating abilities to bear until the intervention is destroyed.'},\n",

An avoral's head has a feathery cowl instead of hair, typically brown, white, gray, or golden, and its facial features are bird-like, with a large nose and piercing eyes. Its bones are hollow but strong, making it ideal for flying. Like eagles, avorals have phenomenal vision, and can see fine details even at great distances. Though on their home plane they are content to soar among the clouds and challenge each other to diving contests among the mountain peaks, in war avorals are the scouts, spies, and messengers of the agathions. With their incredible speed, phenomenal eyesight, and magical powers, they can sneak into an area, spy on whatever lives there, silently converse with the local fauna for additional information, and fly or teleport out again with a comprehensive report. They are experts at hit-and-run attacks and are often responsible for ferrying other celestial soldiers to battle. A typical avoral is 7 feet tall but weighs only 120 pounds.\"},\n",

       "   'description': \"Draconals are mighty agathion lords, few in number and greatly removed from mortal affairs. They watch over powerful magic and are direct agents of the gods and the needs of the good planes. Patient and ageless, they plan for the long term, which often frustrates mortal creatures who seek to gain their assistance with a threat in the here and now. A draconal would rather support or enhance a group of heroes than tackle a problem directly, maintaining its focus on planar matters. Draconals are attuned to nature and believe in cycles of life and death. Though they are good, they understand that the presence of evil gives good creatures something to strive against, preventing stagnation and complacency. This means their outlook sometimes appears almost neutral, though they hate suffering and needless death. DRACONAL COLORS A draconal's coloration represents mystical elements relating to energy, life, and the natural world. These colors are normally chromatic rather than metallic, and an ignorant person seeing a draconal's colors may mistake her for an evil half-dragon. However, some draconals have metallic or gem-like coloration; for example, a yellow draconal may appear mustard yellow or metallic gold, while a white draconal may be chalk white, pearlescent white, or metallic silver. Draconals can change their coloration after a lengthy period of meditation, but normally only do this in response to some horrible evil that requires their direct intervention. This change affects the draconals' personality, and may alter their physical shape or apparent gender. Black: Black is a balance between male and female energy, and represents the sky, stars, immortality, and leadership. Black draconals are immune to fire damage, and their breath weapon is fire. A black draconal adds Fire, Glory, and Luck to its list of possible domains. Green: Green is slightly skewed toward masculinity. It represents wood, plants, and flowers. Green draconals are immune to cold damage, and their breath weapon is cold. A green draconal adds Animal, Plant, and Water to its list of possible domains. Red: Red is a strongly masculine color, and most red draconals are male or have aggressive or gregarious personalities. Red represents fire, light, and warding against bad luck. Red draconals are immune to fire damage, and their breath weapon is fire. A red draconal adds Fire, Protection, and Sun to its list of possible domains. White: White is slightly skewed toward femininity, and most white draconals are female or have protective or serene personalities. White represents brightness, fulfillment, metal, mourning, and purity. White draconals are immune to cold damage, and their breath weapon is cold. A white draconal adds Artifice, Liberation, and Repose to its list of possible domains. Yellow: Like black, yellow is a balance between male and female energy. Yellow represents earth, oracles, stone, and luck. Yellow draconals are immune to acid, and their breath weapon is acid. A yellow draconal adds Earth, Glory, and Luck to its list of possible domains.\"},\n",

Though gentle with their families and patient with strangers on their home plane, in battle leonals are deadly foes of evil and cruelty. They hunt fiends and other evil monsters, silently tailing their prey until they find the right time to leap and slash. Leonals pride themselves on their hunting prowess, and few land creatures can match their speed. Although capable of using weapons, the majority of leonals prefer to battle evil with tooth and claw. Leonals like their battles to be straightforward affairs. They begin with a roar to put their foes off balance, then follow up with claw and bite attacks. They closely coordinate with others in their pride, watching one another's flanks and setting up devastating attacks. They mainly use their magical abilities against large numbers of weaker foes and against those they need to capture or incapacitate without dealing harm to them. Leonals stand 6 feet tall and weigh 270 pounds on average. Males usually have manes of either dark gold or black hair, which may only surround the head or may extend onto the shoulders and chest. Female leonals do not have manes, but may have longer hair on the back of the neck.\"},\n",

Unobtrusive and able to blend in among normal animals (unlike the more anthropomorphic agathions), they are the eyes and ears of the good planes in the mortal world. Most roam hills, forests, and plains, keeping an eye out for evil inf luences. They can be taken as familiars by 7th-level good spellcasters with the Improved Familiar feat who meet the proper prerequisites. As familiars, silvanshees act as moral guides and steer their mortal allies toward corruptive forces that must be eliminated. In some mortal lands, they are called cat sìth or cath sidhe, and are believed to be disguised witches or fairies-and not necessarily benign creatures, which only encourages silvanshees to avoid strangers. Silvanshees are not fond of open combat, even against demons, devils, or other fiendish threats, and they're likely to run away if confronted. When they must fight, they prefer greater numbers and the element of surprise, using their magic to temporarily overcome their physical weaknesses, and melting away into mist if the battle turns against them. A silvanshee is the size of a large domestic cat, though almost always sleek rather than fat, and weighs 20 pounds on average.\"},\n",

A vulpinal looks like a humanoid fox, often with brilliantly colored fur (usually red or red-brown, though silver is not uncommon) and a tail as long as its height. As the bards and sages of the agathions, they dress in functional clothing, typically embellishing a single article to show their creativity and personality. Most appear to be adults, though others look more like fox kits (with shorter stature and larger eyes) while some look much older (leaner, with gray fur on the muzzle, chest, and tail). Their hands are humanoid in shape, with tiny clawed fingers. A typical vulpinal prefers a life of solitary travel, though they have been known to pair up or travel in groups if they find like-minded individuals who have much to teach and share. They are particularly fond of lillends, and these winged azatas can easily carry the child-sized vulpinals, giving vulpinals many opportunities to share stories. Indeed, for a vulpinal, there are few greater pleasures than sharing their knowledge-acting as sages of the planes, teaching songs and dances from exotic places, and composing poems about beautiful places in the natural world. Though they are gentle by nature, they fight to defend beauty, especially if their magic can bolster the more martial celestial races. A vulpinal stands about 3 feet in height and weighs 50 pounds.'},\n",

It travels in a strange, undulant crawl akin to that of a sidewinder, looping the coils of its long body back and forth and keeping both of its heads at the alert. Amphisbaenas are said to have formed from the blood of medusas, and while such stories are highly suspect, the creatures possess a natural immunity to petrification, which make them favored pets of medusas or other creatures with the petrification ability. Adult amphisbaenas can grow up to 14 feet in length and weigh as much as 250 pounds. While their thick coils twitch and ripple with muscle, they are not constrictors; their attacks rely on speed and their deadly venom. Most amphisbaenas have dark, bluish-black scales with lighter bands; however, they can be encountered in a variety of colors appropriate to their habitats. Some reports even claim lizard-like versions of this beast exists, with short legs and long curved talons. The amphisbaena's two heads can act independently, and the creature can move freely in either direction. In combat, it uses this ability to its utmost advantage, constantly spinning about to change up the direction of its strikes and guarding against enemies attempting to sneak closer or flank it. Unlike most snakes, amphisbaenas are aggressive, attacking anything that enters their territory. While they prefer smaller prey, they have been known to hunt gnomes, half lings, and other Small humanoids, and will sometimes attack larger foes if they're starving or preparing to shed. Amphisbaenas reproduce infrequently, laying small clutches of up to a dozen dark onyx eggs at a time. Avidly sought by animal trainers and collectors, amphisbaena eggs can fetch between 300 to 500 gp on the market. Despite minimal intelligence, amphisbaenas are driven primarily by their instincts and are extremely difficult and dangerous to train. All attempts to train an amphisbaena take a -8 penalty on any Handle Animal checks as a result.\"},\n",

They serve as messengers for more powerful angels, and on the Material Plane they are often bound to good mortals to serve as familiars, acting as spiritual guides, reciting platitudes and quoting scripture from various benign faiths and philosophies (some forgotten for centuries). A 7th-level lawful good spellcaster with the Improved Familiar feat can select a cassisian as a familiar. A cassisian's true form is a helmet possessing a pair of bird's wings. The exact style of helmet varies by the deity the angel serves-most appear to be steel with angular cheek-plates, though some resemble bascinets, skullcaps, great helms, or even samurai helmets, and a few older cassisians appear to be bronze or even leather. Though cassisians can assume other forms (that of a child-sized angelic humanoid wearing a proportional helmet matching the cassisians' true form, a dove, a dog, or a fish), they find it strange and rarely stay in that form for more than a few minutes. Typically formed from the souls of trustworthy and pious soldiers, some cassisians arise spontaneously from the spiritual fragments of great angels destroyed while defending the celestial planes against fiendish incursions. In many cases, the lowly cassisian retains fragments of its previous life's memories, and friends of that old soul may visit with the cassisian to reminisce with what remains. Unfortunately, the reincarnated angel's memories are more like something memorized from a book, and lack the character and camaraderie the friends expect.\"},\n",

In the armies of the good planes, they are leaders and officers, and after centuries of service to a deity, they may be transformed into astral devas. Monadic devas like giving their maces names and proudly announcing them in battle with evil foes. Many of these weapons have seen battle for thousands of years and are quite battered. Younger devas may lend their weapons to good churches on the Material Plane so they can be used by great mortal heroes, though the angels eventually reclaim them after no more than a year and a day.

To survive, this animate dream needs the power of living will, imagination, and emotion to sustain it. An animate dream seeks out mortal minds, appearing as a shadowy and often frightful dream figure. Its true appearance is vague and nebulous, but it reacts to the fears and emotions of those around it, taking on a nightmarish appearance that differs for each viewer. An animate dream can find satisfaction and sustenance by passing one of its ghostly limbs through a mortal's body-the act infusing the mortal with negative energy that sates the animate dream's unnatural hunger. But by forcing a creature into a state of sleep, terror, or both, the animate dream can gain a much more satisfying meal, feeding on the emotions released in such states. It uses its spell-like abilities to this end, for each creature it harms with its nightmares, drives temporarily insane with confusion or fear, or outright slays with phantasmal killer provides the monster with more nourishment. An animate dream forced to go for a long period of time without feeding does not starve to death, but does grow increasingly feral and violent in nature. Animate dreams sometimes associate with other creatures from the Ethereal Plane or that have associations with dreams and nightmares, such as night hags, phase spiders, and xills. Sometimes these alliances are mutually beneficial, but in many cases the animate dreams are treated as slaves. Night hags in particular like enslaving animate dreams, and sometimes use their essence as a component in creating heartstones.\"},\n",

In its natural form, an aranea resembles a humpbacked spider a little bigger than a human, and weighs about 150 pounds. The hump on its back houses the aranea's brain. All araneas have a single alternate form as well-this alternate form is that of a Small or Medium humanoid. Although an aranea can assume a spider-hybrid variant of this form, it cannot use its change shape ability to assume multiple humanoid forms-this additional shape is locked into one unique appearance. Araneas typically gather in small colonies of two to six individuals, making webbed nests high in trees. These colonies work together to research magic, and may change membership many times over as individuals leave to pursue their own studies and are replaced by newer members. A single aranea may take on humanoid form and live for years in a humanoid community, never revealing its true nature. Though araneas generally prefer to be left alone, they often prove quite knowledgeable about the ways of magic, and if approached peacefully may be willing to share their expertise for the right price (typically a magic item or some service). Skilled spellcasters, araneas try to avoid physical combat and use their webs and spells when they can. Rather than kill their enemies, araneas often subdue opponents and hold them for ransom.\"},\n",

Rather than animating the body of the dead youth, the creature rises from an amalgam of old toys, clothing, dust, and other objects associated with the departed-icons of the child's neglect. The widely varying materials that fuse together to form these creatures lead to attic whisperers with vastly different appearances. Attic whisperers linger in the places where they were formed, typically old homes, orphanages, schools, debtors' prisons, workhouses, and similar places where children might be discarded. When an attic whisperer first forms, it does so without a skull-this does not impact the creature's abilities in any way, but it usually seeks out a small animal's skull as a form of decoration soon after it manifests. An attic whisperers haunts shadowy, forgotten places like old buildings and dilapidated institutions, places that were once homes to both young children and subtle evils. Hiding in drafty attics and moldy basements, an attic whisperer might lie dormant for decades while the quick go about their lives-often a scant floor away. The coming of a new child, though, rekindles some hope in the creature, its animating spirits motivated by loneliness, and ever seeking comfort and companionship. Once an attic whisperer finds a potential playmate, it does all it can to ensure it will never be lonely again by attempting to lure its friend to it, singing nursery rhymes, leaving trails of old toys, or calling out in the stolen voices of other children. Destroying an attic whisperer reduces it to its component parts, usually consisting of dusty junk left to molder in the attics of old houses, though a few items, such as china dolls, small lockets, music boxes, precious marbles, fine teacups, sculpted metal soldiers, or the like, may have some value.\"},\n",

In addition to fresh meat, aurumvoraxes are fond of gnawing on metals (particularly gold and copper), though whether they do this to sharpen their teeth or because of some nutritional need is unknown. Aurumvorax warrens can stretch for thousands of feet, often winding deep into the earth. The avaricious appetite of aurumvoraxes has earned them the appellation \"golden gorger\" among dwarves, who have lost more than a few miners to the dangerous beasts. In battle, an aurumvorax latches onto its victim with its jaws and gouges savage wounds with its claws. It rarely looses its grip before it or its foe is dead. It typically attacks the nearest living creature regardless of size, and ignores any wounds it suffers at the hands of others until its prey is dead. A typical aurumvorax is only 3 feet long but weighs more than 200 pounds, for it is densely packed with muscle and thick, sturdy bones. Its fur is golden, while its claws are black and sharp. Its weight relative to its body size makes it a poor swimmer, and most dislike crossing water, though they can trundle along the bottom of still or slow water if necessary. Adult aurumvoraxes are impossible to train, but their offspring are valued for training as guard beasts. A healthy aurumvorax kit can be sold for 5,000 gp or more to a discerning buyer. Female aurumvoraxes rarely give birth to more than one offspring at a time, and are ferociously protective of their young. An aurumvorax drags its prey back to its lair to consume at its leisure, and its bone-midden often contains valuable belongings from past kills. Uneaten precious metals, discarded gems, and well-chewed metal items can also be found in its warrens. Despite its metallic coloration, an aurumvorax is not vulnerable to attacks that target metal, such as heat metal or the touch of a rust monster-in fact, aurumvoraxes easily kill and eat rust monsters, and some dwarf clans use aurumvorax pets to protect their storehouses against them.'},\n",

According to their own history, the first axiomites sprang from the raw mathematical underpinnings of the cosmos long before the first gods began to stir-they are personifications of a primordial reality made flesh in an attempt to understand itself. New axiomites are formed from souls much like celestials or fiends, with spirits drawn across the planes to one of the axiomites' humming crystal monoliths, emerging later as purified creatures of law and theory. A particular axiomite may look like any humanoid-shaped creature, though the particular form does not affect its abilities in any way. Beneath this form, all axiomites are the same-clouds of glowing, crystalline dust that constantly swirl and congeal into complex tangles of symbols and equations, making them literally creatures of pure mathematical law. Axiomite society is broken into three divisions, each with its own duty and purpose. One devotes itself to the construction and maintenance of inevitables, another to the expansion and construction of their capital city, and the third to continuing the exploration and calculation of the laws and constants that underlie all of reality. Their leader is a gestalt mind formed by the greatest individuals of their race, forming when needed and then dispersing into its component axiomites to put the god-mind's plans into action.\"},\n",

Mortals who please them with excellent tales and new songs may be rewarded with elaborate maps, forgotten shortcuts, or rambling directions to hidden locations that hold lost magic. Lyrakien are light-hearted creatures, but they are very protective of breathtaking natural locations. Often called \"glistenwings\" by gnomes and half lings, lyrakien are frequently mistaken for fey-while they are generally friendly with true fey, their origin is the plane of Elysium.

Though their power is tied to primal destruction, they are quick-witted and love clever wordplay, whether in a sonnet or a dirty limerick. The brijidine sees fire as a form of purity, a marked difference from its classical association with devastation and destruction. To a brijidine, the existence of hellfire is the rankest blasphemy, and while many azatas look to the demons of the Abyss as their greatest enemies, it is among the devils of Hell that most brijidines find focus for their anger. The fact that devils are immune to fire, the brijidine's greatest strength, frustrates and angers these azatas all the more, forcing them to become far more imaginative and creative in their tactics when facing such foes.

Azers live in a society where every member knows his place. Born into a particular duty, usually the trade of his father or mother, an azer continues this task his entire life. A caste system further keeps azer society in line. Nobles, ruling without question, wear decorated brass kilts as their symbol of caste, while merchants and business proprietors wear stout bronze. Copper kilts designate the working class, made up of servants, artisans, and laborers. Able to channel heat through metal weapons and tools, azers almost never use nonmetallic weapons, and usually engage in close melee rather than using ranged attacks. Azers frequently take prisoners, bringing them back to their fortresses and forcing them to labor for a year and a day. The legendary City of Brass boasts an azer population over half a million strong. Most of these unfortunate azers live a life of servitude to their efreet masters. Azers subjected to this slavery still perform their duties without question, preferring to wait out their contracts or hoping their masters die or get overthrown. A dedication to order burns strong in this race, to the extent that some enslaved azers act as taskmasters over their own kin. Beyond the City of Brass, azers are free to live their own lives, often in other planar metropolises crafting goods, selling wares, and running taverns. Azers look strikingly similar to one another to the unfamiliar eye. They are 4 feet tall, but weigh 200 pounds.'},\n",

Dire badgers reside in deep burrows and warrens dug with their monstrous claws-but unlike typical badgers, a dire badger's claws are capable of tunneling through solid rock. Dire badgers possess little patience for disturbances or interruptions. Utterly fearless creatures, when confronted they attack brutally, and if injured, they violently erupt into a killing frenzy.

A pound of royal jelly provides enough nourishment for a full day, and grants a +4 resistance bonus on all saving throws against disease for the next 24 hours. If a creature sleeps enough to heal damage within 24 hours of eating at least a pound of royal jelly, it heals twice the hit points and ability damage as it otherwise would.

Belkers create no permanent lairs, but do claim and defend large territories from other living things, particularly areas ravaged by frequent storms, volcanic eruptions, hot springs, or forest fires.

They live in the darkest, dampest regions of cavernous sprawls, particularly enjoying underground bogs, lakes, rivers, and swamps. Although not aquatic, blindheims are excellent swimmers. They prefer to latch onto branches or rock outcroppings, where they maintain the high ground while in pursuit of food. They use the light from their eyes to attract prey, but go dark when larger creatures approach. A blindheim uses its blinding gaze to disorient both prey and possible threats, then deactivates its gaze to scuttle away in the dark if the threat is too great. In very large caverns inhabited by blindheims, distant areas often flicker from brightly lit to absolutely dark as the creatures feed and flee. Though of animal-level intelligence, blindheims are cunning enough to coordinate their hunting tactics with others of their kind, using one creature to act as a lookout and make hit-and-run attacks with its gaze until its fellows can arrive to help finish off the prey. Blindheims can convey simple information through gestures and flashes of their lights, and tend to be rather silent in combat, adding an eerie element to battles with them. They cannot be taught to perform humanoidappropriate labors and thus make poor slaves, though the duergar and drow sometimes use them as bait or distractions when raiding. Other races have been known to train these creatures as mobile light sources when going on long underground expeditions. Stout and thick-skinned, a blindheim is just under 4 feet in height and weighs 150 pounds. A blindheim gives birth to small litters of three or four young. Though gestation can last up to a full year, it only takes about 4 years for a blindheim to mature and become self-reliant, at which point the creatures generally form broods that stick together, only striking out on their own if their brethren have perished. Blindheims can live for up to 25 years.'},\n",

As social creatures, blink dogs travel in large packs, roaming forests and plains, running off evil creatures, and hunting for phase spiders-one of their natural enemies. Despite their intelligence and friendly natures, blink dogs tend to avoid humanoids, keeping their packs either hidden or frequently on the move. This shyness doesn't keep the blink dogs from helping out when needed, however, and they have been known to come to the rescue of a prairie village in their territory. Packs are typically led by an older, experienced male or female, called an alpha. Blink dogs are fiercely loyal, defending their own pack or creatures they befriend to the death, and maintaining oaths handed down from litter to litter. Honor is paramount to blink dogs, and different packs often have unique traditions (such as whether a pack's alpha is male or female, or an oath to always protect and aid a particular humanoid race like elves or half lings) in addition to those shared by most blink dogs. Blink dogs have a great interest in the stars and movements of celestial bodies. Through their myths and folklore, blink dogs have names for constellations, and through this zodiac they note the seasons, births under auspicious stars, and omens from unusual stellar conjunctions. Blink dog names often contain a reference to a specific constellation under which the dog was born. Blink dogs stand nearly 3 feet at the shoulder and weigh upward of 180 pounds. They can live up to 75 years. They use their abilities to quickly surround prey, and make use of flanking to deal with especially dangerous opponents-particularly creatures like phase spiders. Blink Dog Sages A pack's alpha selects the wisest and most intelligent member of the pack to serve as its sage. This blink dog often has sorcerer levels (typically with the celestial or destined bloodline) and is charged with maintaining the long-running oral histories of the pack, which extend back for centuries and link the packs together. A blink dog sage also decides when a pup is old enough to join his first hunt, performs birth and burial rites, and counsels the alpha on the meaning of omens or upon tactical matters involving interactions with neighboring races and creatures. In some packs, the sage is the alpha's mate, while in others the sage is always a gray-muzzled elder hound beyond breeding age.\"},\n",

Changed into a twisted, misanthropic husk, a bodak wanders the endless tracts of evil-aligned planes, periodically stumbling into other realms by passing through portals or otherwise being conjured elsewhere. Possessing only fragmented memories of its former existence, the bodak is driven by profound emptiness, sorrowful longing, and vengeful hatred of all life. A bodak's appearance is profoundly disturbing. Its flesh looks dried, taut, and desiccated, though it possesses a strange, otherworldly sheen. Its body is disproportionate and distinctly androgynous. Hairless and with only vague hints of facial structure, the bodak's eyes are deep set in their sockets and constantly weep foul-smelling smoky vapors. A planes-wise traveler who recognizes its shape knows to flee, for most travelers can outrun the relatively slow bodak. Bodaks vehemently despise all living creatures and immediately seek to destroy any they encounter. A bodak retains the ability to speak one language it knew in life (typically Common), but it rarely engages in conversation, instead spitting out an incomprehensible stream of vile accusations, curses, and threats. On occasion, a bodak might wield weapons, but most rely primarily upon the effects of their deadly gaze. Bodaks are rarely encountered outside of the Abyss. As they are slow-witted, powerful evil creatures such as liches and nabasu demons sometimes use bodaks as thralls, assassins, or guardians. Bodaks encountered on the Material Plane exude extreme malevolence when forced to confront the realization of their abhorrent transformations. So great is their desire to inf lict their fate upon others that many attempt to drag off the bodies of their slain victims and guard them until they rise as undead. A 20th-level spellcaster can use create greater undead to create a bodak, but only if the spell is cast while the spellcaster is located on one of the evil outer planes (traditionally the Abyss).\"},\n",

When facing danger, brownies rarely engage in combat, preferring instead to confound and confuse their attackers in order to buy enough time for escape. Content with honest toil and the love of their kin, brownies maintain a pacifist nature, only harassing creatures to run them off or punish them for an insult. Despite this nature, all brownies carry a blade. They refer to their swords with a hint of disgust, and jokingly call their blades the \"final trick,\" using them only in the direst of consequences. Honest to a fault, brownies take freely, but always repay their debt through work or leave something behind as an offering. They may eat an apple from a farmer\\'s orchard, but will harvest the entire tree as repayment. A brownie might eat an entire pie left on a windowsill, only to straighten up the kitchen or wash the dishes. A brownie can share a home with a family for years and years while avoiding detection. A family that is aware of a brownie usually finds this a beneficial relationship and leaves dishes of milk, pieces of fruit, trinkets, and sometimes even wine as gifts. In exchange, the brownie keeps the home clean, mends clothes, repairs tools, and shoos away vermin and small predators. Bragging about having a brownie in the house is the best way to lose one.

A bunyip typically inhabits large freshwater inlets or sheltered coastal sea caves where food is plentiful-the bunyip is equally at home in fresh or salt water. It prefers feeding on animals of Small size or larger, though it isn't averse to eating humanoids when presented the opportunity. Bunyips are quite territorial, and readily attack when intruders threaten their hunting grounds. Bunyips mate annually, during the late spring. During this period, bunyips become even more aggressive. After mating, couples split, with the female wandering off to find a place to birth a small litter of four to six pups. Females watch their pups for a few days, until they become independent enough for the mothers to move on. Reports of bunyip sightings come from every end of the map. Though the accuracy of all such reports remains doubtful, enough reliable accounts exist to confirm their widespread adaptability. The species thrives in numerous ecological climes, from frigid polar fjords to idyllic tropical lagoons. The bunyip is not a deep-sea creature, and even avoids larger freshwater lakes, as it prefers to lurk near shorelines where its favorite food is more common. While bunyips vary in appearance, all possess similar basic physical structures. The bunyip's head exhibits strong seal-like features, save for its shark-like jaws. Its upper torso is thick and muscular, with long, fin-like limbs. Some species even have a single, shark-like dorsal fin. The remaining portion of the body extends into a long tail. Those with fur usually only grow a short coat on the upper body in shades of pale gray, brown, or black.\"},\n",

Carnivorous blobs move like a typical ooze, rolling out blobs of its fleshy material in haphazard directions, and pulling its bulk across the ground, up walls, and even through the water. If a carnivorous blob goes for more than 24 hours without a source of food, it drops into a sort of hibernation, resembling nothing so much as a pool of gelatinous blood.

       "   'description': \"The catoblepas is an aggressive beast at the best of times, willing to knock down trees, fences, even small houses to eat whatever it finds interesting, be that meal plant or animal or human being. Though it prefers swamps, the catoblepas has been known to forage in plains and forests for short periods before returning to the buoyant support of water and mud. Few creatures linger near a catoblepas's feeding ground because of the monster's bad temper and poisonous breath, and only rot-loving predators such as oozes or exceptionally large otyughs have any interest in hunting them. A catoblepas' primary motivation is hunting and exerting its dominance over lesser creatures in its territory. Easily detected by its foul odor, the creature tolerates the presence of wild animals, humanoid tribes, and even predators that it can bully as long as these things flee or act submissive when the poisonous brute lumbers into view. The catoblepas is known to engage in physical battles with other Large swamp creatures such as crocodiles or even froghemoths. Some humanoid tribes claim to know techniques to domesticate a catoblepas for use as a guard animal, but the monster's intractable nature and not insignificant intelligence almost certainly means magic is involved, as the creature has little need for alliances and can wipe out entire villages with its breath. Some have been known to use their breath underwater, creating a churning cloud of bubbles that kills fish in the area and starves out other creatures. A catoblepas's sense of smell is blunted by its own ungodly stench, and it can't easily recognize rival odors such as skunk musk (though this provides the beast no immunity to odor-based effects from other creatures). A catoblepas is 15 feet long and weighs 2,200 pounds.\"},\n",

A typical charda stands just under 4 feet tall but weighs 250 pounds. Chardas reproduce by laying eggs in small clutches of two to four, which they bury among rocks offshore. Females fiercely protect their own clutches, but show no predisposition toward protecting the clutches of other chardas, even those within their tribe. Devoutly religious, chardas prefer to worship gods of war or cold. They hunt in small packs composed of both males and females. Hunting and slaying help determine an individual's power within the group. Chardas often engage in infanticide and cannibalism. While they patrol their territories in groups, they fight individually with little strategy or structure. Chardas do not assist each other with their kills, as they perceive aid as a weakness and a dishonor to both themselves and their foes.\"},\n",

So legendary are these violent attacks that many sailors have come to view the charybdis not as a species of aberrant life, but as the vengeful personification of an angry sea god. In truth, the charybdis is not the sending of an angry deity, but in fact little more than a monstrous predator capable of churning even the calmest of seas into a whirling maelstrom. The charybdis uses this vortex ability not only to capture prey like sharks or small whales, but also to entrap ships on the ocean surface above. The monster's claws are particularly well suited to puncturing the hulls of ships, and most charybdises have learned that a single large merchant vessel contains enough sailors to make a perfectly sized meal. Often, a charybdis settles in along a well-known shipping route near the shoreline or amid an archipelago of islands where ships are forced along relatively narrow lanes between rocky isles-such locations allow the charybdis to lie in wait and increases the chance of its prey being unable to circumvent its vortex. A charybdis is 60 feet long and weighs 26,000 pounds.\"},\n",

       "   'description': 'These notorious predators have an undeniable thirst for blood. Chupacabras prefer to prey upon the weak and slow, often watching potential prey from hiding for long periods before attacking. Spry and stealthy, they prefer to keep to areas of high grass and protective rock, their slightly ref lective scales allowing them to blend in well with such surroundings. With a preference for lone travelers and farm animals (particularly goats), chupacabras leave little evidence of their presence apart from the grisly blood-drained husks of their meals, often leading locals to believe a reckless vampire lives in the area. A typical chupacabra measures nearly 5-1/2 feet from muzzle to tail tip and stands just under 4 feet tall. Slightly built and light of bone, most weigh close to a hundred pounds. They mate rarely and only during the hottest months, with the females each producing a single egg that hatches into a tiny, dehydrated creature. The mother typically leaves helpless prey in her cave so the hatchling can immediately feed. Although chupacabras are typically solitary, in bountiful areas small gangs of the beasts can form. These groups work well together, becoming bold enough to attack larger groups of animals and more dangerous prey. Stories of chupacabras attacking travelers or laying siege to farmhouses typically stem from the hunting practices of such gangs. It is not unusual for older chupacabras to grow to Medium size. These larger specimens tend to be leaders of chupacabra gangs, or, more commonly, loners capable of tormenting entire villages on their own. Some chupacabras are mutants with large reptilian wings, and have been known to carry off goats and children. A flying chupacabra has a fly speed of 60 feet (average), which increases to 90 feet (average) when invigorated from drinking blood. A winged chupacabra is the same CR as the normal variety.'},\n",

Necromancers and other spellcasters create them to guard such areas, and the crypt things never leave their appointed lairs, even to pursue enemies. Their warded area may be a single room or passage, an entire grave complex, or even a city-sized necropolis. Though naturally solitary, multiple crypt things may guard a common area, often in conjunction with constructs or other undead. A crypt thing only initiates combat if it is attacked or if the object or crypt it is guarding is touched or entered. Until this condition is met, a crypt thing is content to remain motionless-it may even answer questions or otherwise interact with visitors if its master has directed it to do so. Rumors exist of variant crypt things that do not teleport their foes, but instead paralyze opponents and turn them invisible, leaving victims to helplessly watch their allies being torn apart by the angry guardian.

       "   'description': \"Scorpion-like crysmals originate in the deepest caverns of the Plane of Earth. On rare occasions, these strange creatures wind up on the Material Plane, usually in subterranean areas rich with natural gem and crystal formations. The crystalline planes of their bodies absorb and refract natural light, which some claim is the source of their supernatural powers. It does so by gathering stone crystals and gemstones, fashioning them into a Tiny facsimile of its own body, and jolting the new creature to life with a burst of the crysmal's own life energy. These newly created crysmals are known as shardlings (treat as a crysmal with the young creature simple template), and grow to adulthood after a few months of gorging on crystals and gemstones. To make a single shardling, a crysmal requires 1,000 gp worth of crystals. Until it has enough material to reproduce, it stores these gems inside its body, and if slain, the gems are visible among the shards of the creature's corpse. Because of this reproductive need for gemstones, crysmals are relentless in their pursuit of the treasures, valuing them much as other living creatures value infants of their own race. Crysmals do not recognize that other creatures treat gems as wealth, and attempt to seize gems carried by others whenever the opportunity arises. A crysmal normally uses its spell-like abilities to befuddle opponents, grabbing at pouches with gems when the bearer is distracted, and normally only resorts to physical violence once all other tactics fail.\"},\n",

       "   'description': \"While some of the more powerful daemons are servitors to one of the Four Horsemen, olethrodaemons serve as juggernauts for all of the Four. These massive creatures are the embodiment of death and destruction-the very vessels of apocalypse that daemons wish to see wrought upon the multiverse. These nihilistic behemoths roam the gray expanses of Abaddon, feasting on the souls of evil mortals damned to their realm. When on the Material Plane, olethrodaemons act as agents of destruction, spreading ruin and devouring mortal souls as they plow through cities and countrysides, bent on devastation. It's rare for a mortal to be able to control such a potent force, but sometimes mad spellcasters utilize effects like gate to urge an olethrodaemon to visit a devastating holocaust upon an enemy region-the olethrodaemon generally does not hold a grudge against a mortal that asks such a service from it. These immense creatures stand over 25 feet tall and weigh close to 12,000 pounds, their powerful, muscular bodies covered by durable plates and head thronged with dangerous, twisted horns. Olethrodaemons stand on four stout legs, and possess an equal number of arms, each ending in wickedly sharp claws able to tear through stone as easily as flesh. The creature's eyes, as well as its two mouths, glow like coals in a kiln. The creature feeds on souls and has multiple stomachs to digest mortal essences. While not as intelligent or scheming as many other powerful daemons (or other fiends who match their power, for that matter), olethrodaemons remain dangerous foes. They do not generally wish to lead armies and gain power by control, but rather to revel in the evil purity of annihilation. Among olethrodaemons, the greatest desire is to be the one to devour the very last mortal soul. They angle and shove for this honor, often ceding a city or group of victims to a rival if they believe that, in so doing, they might gain the advantage of positioning to consume the final soul once the multiverse has been devoured. OLETHRODAEMON PARAGONS Just as powerful balors become lords and pit fiends clamor for positions as infernal dukes, olethrodaemons can achieve a unique level of power among their kin. These creatures are known as paragons, and gain this level of power by pledging their loyalty to one of the Four Horsemen as a chosen agent of apocalypse. These advanced olethrodaemons specialize in their patron's particular method of annihilation, their abilities evolving to suit the method of ruin. An olethrodaemon paragon generally has from 4 to 8 additional Hit Dice, and is usually a CR 22 to CR 24 creature. Some planar scholars postulate that olethrodaemons are actually the creations of the Four Horsemen, and that the Four worked foul rites upon a fifth Horseman, with these interactions spawning olethrodaemons to serve their will and spread oblivion throughout the multiverse. The abilities of these chosen spawn warp to the tendencies of their daemonic lords. Olethrodaemons serving the Horseman of Pestilence can infect their victims with a powerful disease by means of all their natural attacks. Creatures who succumb to this attack are affected as if by a maximized contagion spell, heightened to 9th level. Olethrodaemons serving the Horseman of War can imbue their natural attacks with additional properties. As a free action, an olethrodaemon can apply any special weapon property equivalent to a +2 enhancement to its bite, claw, gore, or trample attacks for 1 round-most of these olethrodaemon paragons elect to grant their natural weapons the unholy enhancement. Olethrodaemons serving the Horseman of Famine gain the consumptive aura ability of the meladaemon, but the nonlethal damage dealt increases to 6d6 and victims who succumb become exhausted rather than merely fatigued. Olethrodaemons serving the Horseman of Death gain the ability to inf lict a negative level on a foe each time they strike with a claw attack, or else gain the ability to cause those they damage to age rapidly and grow old and frail with hideous speed.\"},\n",

Dark stalkers direct the slayers for their own ends, grooming them for use against enemies, ever ready to sacrifice a slayer in battle for an advantage, however temporary. Unlike other dark folk, dark slayers embrace their evil impulses. Their pleasures extend more to murder and pain than to theft or mayhem. Dark slayers are obsessed with magical trinkets, coveting them above all else. Sadly, their obsessive need to fiddle and tinker often leaves their pretties broken or depleted. Dark slayers stand just short of 4 feet tall and weigh 50 pounds. Most have a persistent tremor visible in their hands, stilled only when fondling a newfound magic item. Their skin is dead white, dry, and hot to the touch; their eyes are dark and narrow. Dark slayers wear salvaged rags like dark creepers do, but they discard the rags when they grow too tattered or foul-smelling.'},\n",

       "   'description': \"Named for its resemblance to a 10-armed octopus, the strange decapus is one of many bizarre creatures that hail from the deepest caverns of the world. When they are encountered aboveground, their affinity for forests (they particularly enjoy clambering around in tangled canopies) suggests that their original source might be some strange, deep underground cavern wherein magical jungles grow. The decapus is a fairly intelligent creature-an ambush predator that makes excellent use of its ability to weave magical visual illusions and to imitate the voices of other creatures it has heard speaking. Typical decapuses know only the Aklo tongue, but when they use their sound mimicry ability to imitate creatures speaking in other languages, they can typically form short (up to three words long) sentences even when imitating a language they don't actually know. The decapus's physical structure most resembles that of a bloated octopus with 10 tentacles. It lacks bones and takes its shape from its rubbery, muscular flesh. Most have sickly, olive skin patched with scraggly tangles of hair, with darker blue or purple coloration around their faces and crimson or orange tips to their tentacles. These tentacles are covered with tiny suction cups and hooks, affording them great skill at climbing or clutching prey. On the ground, though, they are slow, plodding creatures that flop and wriggle relatively inefficiently. As a result, they prefer regions like forest canopies, narrow fissures, stalactite forests, or other regions where they can use their climb speed. The decapus favors humanoid flesh over all other food; most are quite fond of gnome flesh in particular. This creature has an enormous appetite that often drives it to consume whatever food is available-the decapus is not above cannibalism when other food sources are scarce. For this reason, these monsters are largely solitary creatures, except when the urge to mate overwhelms their urge to feed. Females give birth to small litters of 2-4 live offspring. The females often need to defend them from the males, which, if left unsupervised, typically eat the newborn decapuses. The young mature rapidly, growing to full size after a mere 7 to 11 months, after which they depart to claim their own territories. Once a decapus reaches maturity, it can live to 100 years old-although their violent natures usually result in much shorter lifespans. A typical decapus has a legspan of 8 feet and weighs 200 pounds.\"},\n",

Under these disguises, they have horned brows, clawed fingers, mouths full of tentacles, and crooked goatish legs with cloven hooves. Many scholars have argued over where the otherworldly realm of Leng lies-some believe it can be found among the Outer Planes, while others are convinced it can only be reached via a dimension of dreams. The denizens of Leng can travel to other planes freely, and often do so in strange, black ships, constantly seeking new breeds of slaves or trading rubies for unusual services or magical treasures. At other times, their visits are much more violent, focusing on abducting victims for use as slaves or worse. On Leng, these denizens have long fought a war against that realm's monstrous spiders, a war that sometimes spills over into other worlds. A denizen of Leng weighs 200 pounds and stands roughly 5-1/2 feet tall.\"},\n",

       "   'description': \"Childlike souls tormented and scoured of innocence by the flames of Hell and then reshaped by the mad whims of the archdevil Baalzebul, accuser devils embody the foul, merciless, and pervasive corruptions of the infernal host. From the depths of the Pit they rise in buzzing, shrieking plagues unleashed to taint the land, despoil weak flesh, and reveal exploitable secrets. En masse they display little of the cunning or subtlety typical of devilkind, spreading ruin at the will of their fiendish masters. Alone, though, a zebub is a craven, deceitful thing, lurking in darkness and filth, endlessly spying and vying for the petty favors of greater evils. Accuser devils are almost exclusively formed amid the cesspits of frozen Cocytus, the seventh layer of Hell. Within the Pit they serve countless infernal lords as messengers and spies, with droves being unleashed upon myriad mortal worlds with a mandate to seek out souls ripe for corruption or those whose sins might lead to greater damnations. Many zebubs overstep the freedoms of such vague missions, seeking to manipulate weakwilled or easily intimidated mortals into all manner of trivial evils, dispensing shrill orders in their buzzing, childlike voices. Despite the fact that many zebub plots end in the zebubs' own revelation and destruction, few diabolical lords allow the slaying of their spies to go unpunished. The zebub's ability to grant other creatures visions of what it has witnessed makes it an unusually useful creature to many conjurers. Relatively easy to conjure with a spell like lesser planar ally or lesser planar binding, an accuser devil can be an invaluable spy. One simply orders the foul little devil to become invisible and then inf iltrate an area where visual information is hidden, with orders to teleport back to its point of origin to grant visions of what it observed to its master. Those who make use of accuser devils in this manner should take care to watch their own actions or what they reveal, of course, for such a creature can just as easily be bribed or intimidated into revealing visions that some conjurers might not want being made public. It's common practice among conjurers to kill their accuser devils once they've completed their missions of inf iltration and observation. These lesser devils stand just over 2 feet tall and rarely weigh more than 25 pounds.\"},\n",

A bdellavritra's voice can emanate from its worm-like maw, from any of its human-like mouths, or from all four at once, as it desires.

       "   'description': \"Despite their name, dragon horses are not related to dragons. These noble creatures gain their name from their ability to fly through the air without wings and to create different effects with their misty breath. Dragon horses are solitary creatures, spending most of their time up among the clouds and rarely setting hoof to solid ground. A mated pair of dragon horses remains together to raise its young, but otherwise individuals prefer to be on their own. They are fierce and reclusive, but peaceful and even playful under the right circumstances. Dragon horses sometimes offer aid and assistance to decent folk in need, taking care to use their ability to know alignment to avoid accidentally providing aid to evil creatures, whom they despise. Dragon horse foals are highly prized as potential steeds, but as dragon horses are highly intelligent creatures, they cannot be trained as if they were animals. Instead, one who seeks a dragon horse mount must use diplomacy to secure the creature's aid. Peaceful creatures by nature, dragon horses prefer to avoid combat by flying away. When they are forced to fight (often in response to an evil creature's mayhem), they attempt to deal nonlethal damage to all but evil-aligned foes, leaving any unconscious opponents unharmed. Those who have chosen evil ways may sometimes receive the same mercy, in the hope that it helps them see the light, but innately evil foes are dispatched as quickly and cleanly as possible.\"},\n",

The creatures typically lair in overgrown or lightly wooded areas, using foliage as cover. When they spot potential prey out in the open, the dragonf lies swoop to the attack, using their superior flight speed and maneuverability to run most prey to ground or carrying off smaller foes to eat them somewhere safe. Giant dragonf lies feed on carrion when fresh prey is not available, and the scent of a fresh kill often attracts them. Many swamp-dwelling cultures attach religious significance to brightly colored and ravenous giant dragonf lies, particularly boggards. The frog-men attach particular significance to a giant dragonf ly's color, and their priest-kings often refuse to eat anything but specific colors of giant dragonf lies.\"},\n",

Forest drakes mate once a year, but do little to raise their offspring. A female lays a clutch of four to eight eggs, but abandons her young as soon as they hatch.

These foul beings are usually created when humanoid creatures are lost at sea in regions haunted by evil spirits or necromantic effects. The corpses of these drowned sailors cling fiercely to unlife, attacking any living creatures that intrude upon them. Their attacks smear rancid flesh, rotting seaweed, and swaths of vermin on whatever they hit. In the case of draugr who manifest when an entire ship sinks, these undead usually stay with the wreck of their ship. Some draugr may be found under the control of aquatic necromancers, while others may wander the seas as undead pirates aboard ghost ships. DRAUGR CAPTAIN (CR 3) Draugr captains have malevolent, burning red eyes. They may be more richly dressed than other draugr, though their clothes are always in a similar tattered condition. A draugr captain is a draugr with the advanced simple template. In addition to this, most draugr captains have additional class levels, usually as barbarians, fighters, or rogues. Draugr captains can also use obscuring mist as a spell-like ability (CL 5th, concentration +8) three times per day, and instead of causing nausea with a successful hit, they bestow 1 negative level on a hit. A draugr captain can even bestow a negative level via a weapon it wields, but if it gains multiple attacks with a weapon, it can only bestow 1 negative level per round in this manner.'},\n",

Its five arms are long and thin, and covered with hundreds of barbed, tubular cilia that the creature uses to move as well at grab and grapple prey. At the fleshy center of the creature's body gapes a circular maw lined with large sharp teeth. As ambush predators, dust diggers spend the majority of their lives buried beneath the sand, waiting patiently for prey to stumble over their ambush site. Dust diggers are asexual. They reproduce by budding, splitting off young three to four times over the course of their 10-year lives-smaller versions of themselves that must immediately move away from the parent to avoid being snatched up and eaten. Dust digger young are just over 4 feet across, and can move relatively quickly through sand (their burrow speed is 40 feet). Usually, a young dust digger travels at least a mile from its parent before it settles down to create its first ambush-the amount of life in the region it has chosen as its new lair often determines whether the new dust digger thrives or starves to death, for once it digs its first ambush, it rarely moves more than a few hundred feet away over the course of its life.\"},\n",

The average d'ziriak is 7 feet tall and has four arms, two legs, a termite-like abdomen, and a mandibled visage somewhere between that of insect and human. Two of its arms are large and possess sharp claws, while the other two are relatively small and used for fine manipulations, not combat. Strangely for a race native to the realm of shadows, the d'ziriaks have a colorful collection of runic shapes, almost like glowing tattoos, upon their chitinous flesh.

       "   'description': \"A nymph's charm and beauty are such that she can seduce nearly any creature that she sets her attentions on-and often, unfortunately, creatures she would rather not consort with. When a nymph catches the attention of a fiend and the fiend takes advantage of the creature, the resulting offspring is not always a half-fiend. Roughly one in 20 such incidents results instead in a strange creature known as a forlarren-a unique creature that possesses its own unusual abilities and qualities. Few nymphs survive the ordeal of giving birth to a forlarren-those who do might attempt to raise their children in loving environments, but the evil that lurks in a forlarren's soul is powerful. In most cases where a nymph attempts to raise a forlarren child, it's only a matter of time before the forlarren grows resentful and its evil nature compels it to murder its mother. Most forlarrens are female, and few are capable of conceiving children of their own. A forlarren grows to adulthood with astonishing speed, reaching full growth in only a year-even those who come into the world as orphans are capable of defending themselves and seeking out food. Yet despite the rapidity with which they reach maturity, few forlarrens survive to adulthood. Cast out from both sylvan and fiendish society, the typical forlarren is a lonely creature, cursed by its own existence. It detests itself and everything it sees, and soon becomes consumed by hatred of life itself. The forlarren vents its rage on good and evil alike, lashing out at anything that approaches it. The forlarren attacks with its clawed hands, typically focusing on a single opponent at a time and attacking until it or its opponent is slain. Yet curiously, when a forlarren succeeds in killing an opponent, the kindly traits of its fey mother sometimes surface, and it shows profound remorse for its cruelty. With such a pendulum of erratic behavior, it is no wonder that forlarrens are all but incapable of forming lasting friendships-even with others of their own kind. The majority of forlarrens inherit little in the way of the magical abilities possessed by their fey mothers, but they do gain a small measure of the powers of their fiendish fathers. In most cases, this manifests as the ability to use heat metal three times per day, but some forlarren instead gain a different spell-like ability chosen from the following list: chill metal, flame blade, flaming sphere, gust of wind, summon swarm, or warp wood. A forlarren stands 6 feet tall and weighs about 160 pounds. In theory, these creatures can live for hundreds of years, but most perish through violence before they turn 10.\"},\n",

In the frost worms' far-reaching hunting grounds, they fear only the remorhaz, for the heat generated by an enraged remorhaz causes intense pain to a frost worm. This extreme aversion to heat, as well as its freezing touch and devastating breath weapon, stems from an unusual facet of frost worm physiology-veins that run with magically cold blood. This creature's ichor is clear, but infused with such sub-freezing temperatures that the monster's flesh can freeze water in the skin of creatures that touch it. When a frost worm dies, this magical energy dissipates, and both blood and muscle immediately freeze solid and then explode into a catastrophic barrage of icy shrapnel. As a result, even those predators that might legitimately prey upon the burrowing monstrosities tend to leave frost worms well enough alone. An adult frost worm measures 35 feet long and weighs 8,000 pounds.\"},\n",

Over thousands of years, they have prospered and spread beneath the world, dominating the wildest depths of these underground regions. Like hyenas, fungal crawlers are top-tier scavengers. They are efficient hunters, but just as often feed on found carrion or take meals from other predators. When times are especially lean, fungal crawlers can even survive without food, subsisting on radiation and heat absorbed through the fungal flutes covering their pale, sickly bellies. Thousands of breeds of fungal crawlers exist across the world, varying in appearance and habits, but all share a few common features. They invariably appear as monstrous crickets or locusts fused with fungal growths, often topped with mushroom-like caps. This hybridization makes them adept survivors, and infestations are notoriously difficult to clear out entirely. Their needle-like teeth cannot chew solid food, so most fungal crawlers rely on digestive enzymes injected through their bite to make their meals palatable. Average specimens grow to 30 pounds and 3 feet in length. They reproduce by releasing spores, which remain viable for decades until they contact organic matter and eventually develop into small, pale grubs. Many subterranean civilizations tame fungal crawlers as guard animals, pets, or food. Though simple-minded, they are amicable enough to be trained when well-fed. Fungal crawlers hold no loyalties, though, and often flee or attack their keepers at the slightest provocation. Thanks to the bizarre energies that suffuse their homes, fungal crawlers are incredibly diverse. They have adapted over millennia to fill every environment: flying variants fill subterranean rifts with the deafening drone of their wings, while aquatic breeds skim across the surfaces of underground lakes, and still others thrive in the fiery chambers and tunnels of volcanic networks.'},\n",

Little is wasted. Taiga giants are also deeply spiritual, worshiping their ancestors. Every tribe member learns to call forth ancestor spirits at a young age. Taiga giants are ashamed of being the ancestors of rune giants as, like most giants, they both hate and fear rune giants as slavers and monsters.

Unlike many of their kin, wood giants are slow to anger, peaceful, and artistic, and display an infinite patience in their duty. A wood giant's role is to preserve and protect the wilderness-a role they believe that nature itself granted them, the proof of which manifests in their magical abilities tied to the natural world. Wood giant culture is as complex as their forest homes. Much of a tribe's time is spent tending to a forest's health: planting new trees, clearing away dead brush, and hunting abominations that pervert the natural order. Individuals may even cultivate their forest homes into elaborate demesnes, mazes, or living temples. They are an isolated race, only rarely meeting to trade with other tribes or the occasional elven settlement. While primarily good-natured, wood giants are distrustful of outsiders and prone to great melancholies. Small clans claim enormous tracts of wooded land, but rarely build permanent homes. Members may spread out over their entire region by day only to gather and bed down, exposed to the elements, after sundown. In harsh weather, tribes cluster close together in the densest thickets with their backs turned outward. Wood giants stand 14 feet tall and weigh 1,200 pounds. They are vegetarians by choice, resorting to eating meat only when no other option is available.\"},\n",

While gloomwings can be conjured via spells like lesser planar ally or lesser planar binding to serve as guardians or even mounts, occasionally a gloomwing will slip through a tear in the fabric of the planes and make the journey to the Material Plane on its own. A gloomwing loose on the Material Plane is active for 2 to 3 hours at dawn and again for 2 to 3 hours at dusk, preferring to spend the remaining hours of the day hiding in abandoned buildings, caves, or deep canyons or foliage where the shadows are thickest. During its periods of activity, it flies through the sky on the hunt for creatures to attack and implant its eggs in-the gloomwing does not need to eat, leaving this urge to propagate its species as its primary drive. For all the dangers a gloomwing presents, it is the creature's young that pose the gravest threat. These creatures are known as tenebrous worms (see page 260), and despite being the larval form of the adult gloomwing, are much more dangerous creatures. The fact that a gloomwing can lay several eggs a day if presented with enough living hosts makes them dangerous not for what they can inf lict themselves, but for what they can spawn.\"},\n",

       "   'description': 'Standing over 9 feet tall and weighing in excess of 4,000 pounds, a gray render is a solitary and savage predator. Renders are gifted with immense strength, and some reports claim to have witnessed a gray render uprooting a fully grown tree and tearing it to splinters in order to catch prey hiding within. Gray renders actively avoid forming groups or communities with their own kind, and perhaps only tolerate the presence of other renders when it is time to mate. Some sages claim they are asexual, but it is more likely they are hermaphrodites able to self-fertilize, and reproduce only rarely. Despite its solitary existence, a gray render often develops an affectionate bond with other creatures, typically a herd of herbivores or a small tribe of humanoids, but in some cases a solitary denizen of its swamp. The render acts as a guardian for this creature or creatures, never straying more than a mile away, running to protect them if they are attacked, and providing an offering of meat once each day, as might a domesticated cat. A gray render never harms its protected creatures, and retreats in confusion if they attack it. Most animal \"pets\" grow to accept its presence, and primitive humanoid \"pets\" often believe their guardian is a sign of favor from the gods. A render\\'s bond may last from a few months to as long as 10 years, after which it wanders to a new territory and ignores its former favorites. Renders are generally not malicious, and only attack if hungry or if they or their pets are threatened. A render protecting its pets fights to the death.'},\n",

       "   'description': 'Sneaky and sadistic, jinkins are hideous gremlins that inhabit the dark places underground. Well acclimated to the shadows, they hide in cramped quarters and attack larger creatures when they\\'re strategically positioned. Jinkins commonly work with or near larger or more powerful creatures; these larger creatures provide cover for the jinkins\\' trickery. They use dimension door to exit any battle that goes badly, taking any stolen goods with them. Jinkins delight in leading larger creatures into dangerous caves or pits, usually by lunging out of the shadows to make a single sneak attack against a creature and then running away, taking care while \"fleeing\" to remain visible to their target so that they can lure the victim into a trap. Jinkins also hold dangerous grudges, and one might follow a creature that supposedly slighted it for weeks, looking for an opportunity to take revenge. This revenge can take many forms, from leading horses astray to contaminating food supplies to directing larger monsters toward the begrudged creature. One of the most direct and unwelcome revenges of the jinkins is the destruction or cursing of magical items. Many times they\\'ll observe camped enemies from a distance and either steal an item to tinker with it or just use their tinkering magic at a distance to annoy the item\\'s owner. Once a jinkin has worked its sabotage on a stolen item, the jinkin either grows bored with the item or may attempt to return it to its owner. Jinkin lairs are often cluttered with stolen items that bear curses the jinkins themselves have forgotten all about. Dwarves in particular hate jinkins, with numerous tales in their folklore telling of tragedy at the hands of the gremlins. The loathing is largely mutual. The average jinkin stands almost 2 feet tall and weighs about 13 pounds.'},\n",

       "   'description': \"Nuglub gremlins are deranged; they enjoy combat with a manic glee that other gremlins reserve for destroying devices or creating complex traps. Indeed, they spend long hours sharpening their claws, filing their teeth, and looking for the perfect ledge from which to leap into the fray. If combat doesn't come to them, they seek it out, entering villages and killing innocents by night. Their idea of a good time is murder so silent that the victim never wakes up, so the family members find the remains the next morning and accuse one another of the atrocity. Nuglubs jealously attack armored foes, as the gremlins' hunchbacked forms make it difficult to wear armor made for other humanoids. A group may use its heat metal and shocking grasp abilities to weaken an opponent before mobbing it and trying to knock the foe prone. As soon as an enemy falls to the ground, all nuglubs descend on that target in a frenzy of bloodlust, grappling and biting, holding on like perverse leeches until nothing remains. Though less technically inclined than some of their kin, nuglubs like using traps. Unlike most gremlins, who prefer to sabotage existing machines, nuglubs delight in the stealthy construction of traps in areas their victims consider familiar, rigging these painful and often deadly surprises on front doors, around the floor of beds, or near cribs in nurseries. Nuglubs are the brutes of gremlin-kind. Groups of nuglubs remain small, as they tend to quarrel with each other and cannibalize those on the wrong side of an angry argument. Lone nuglubs often work with other gremlins, as they like proving they're the strongest, and aren't likely to kill and eat their smaller allies (though those slain by other enemies are fair game for a little snacking). Nuglubs typically stand 2-1/2 feet tall and weigh approximately 25 pounds.\"},\n",

They then wait nearby, both to laugh at the inevitable mishaps and to make sure their personal unluckiness is passed off on their victims. Pugwampis live in caves or ruined buildings, occasionally venturing forth to find victims upon which to inf lict their sick senses of humor. Their \"jokes\" tend to involve spikes and excrement, or sometimes pits full of spiders or campsites that flood with swamp water. Certainly only the pugwampis consider their jokes funny. As all pugwampis are somewhat deaf, when not trying to be stealthy, they tend to scream and yell loudly so they can hear themselves and each other. At some point in the distant past, pugwampis became enamored of gnolls, seeing in the beast-men a kindred form and thus aspiring to the height and deadly prowess of the savage warriors, whom they honor as gods.

Those laid low by a grick are rarely consumed on the spot. Instead, fresh food is hauled back to the grick's lair in a tight burrow or high on a cavern ledge, where it is consumed in small bites at the grick's leisure. The origins of the grick are not known. Even though the grick has a rudimentary intelligence, it does not have any society to speak of, and most are encountered alone. On those occasions when unfortunate travelers meet multiple specimens, groups of gricks do not appear to communicate or work together; each instead attacks individual targets and retreats with its prize as soon as it manages to bring down an opponent. Capable predators, gricks also have a strangely weapon-resistant hide that makes them especially dangerous. Many novice adventurers have fallen to grick attacks merely because they were unable to damage the creature with their nonmagical weapons. Those that are familiar with gricks (especially dwarves, morlocks, and troglodytes) know the best strategy for dealing with them is to fall back and wait for more powerful or magical reinforcements. Gricks rely on their dark coloration and ability to climb walls to keep them out of sight until they're ready to spring an ambush. On occasions when food is scarce in a given region, gricks have been known to travel to the surface and roam the wilderness in search of prey, but these sojourns are almost always out of necessity, and end as soon as the gricks find entrances to new subterranean lairs. They prefer darkness and the comfort of a ceiling overhead, avoiding the open sky and going to great lengths to keep the cover of trees, low clouds, or buildings between them and the empty gulf overhead. Jungle Gricks These surface-adapted varieties of the underground grick are shades of green and lurk in the undergrowth of jungles or climb low-hanging branches to drop on unsuspecting prey. Their racial bonus on Stealth checks applies in forested terrain instead of rocky terrain. Jungle gricks are heartier creatures than their underground-dwelling kin-all jungle gricks possess the advanced creature simple template and gain Toughness as a bonus feat.\"},\n",

       "   'description': \"Grigs are tiny fey with the upper bodies of elf-like sprites and cricket bodies below. Their humanoid features vary wildly in individual appearance, but they usually wear their brown, silver, or green hair long and uncombed. In most cases, grigs' skin bears gold or green stripes or markings, and their legs are brightly colored. They prefer to eschew clothes entirely, wearing clothing only when such apparel has desirable magical effects. Grigs stand 1-1/2 feet tall, and weigh just under 10 pounds. Grigs make their homes in thick woods alongside rolling hills, often near bodies of water. In every grig community may be found a clearing where the group observes the moon during its many lunar holidays. Despite their tiny size, grigs are eager to confront evil and vanquish ugliness-as a result, grigs often find themselves in trouble. They rarely attack directly, instead preferring the element of surprise. In combat, grigs maintain their distance and either depend on their spell-like abilities or fire their longbows from afar. Grigs use their movement to their advantage, frequently jumping about their enemies or flying beyond their reach. Gigs excel at music, and can create lively ditties simply by sawing their legs against their bodies. Grig music often stirs people to dance, even when the grigs don't enhance their music with supernatural compulsions. In addition to loving music, grigs enjoy the visual arts, especially paintings and sketches, and they often decorate their homes with bright colors and delightful images.\"},\n",

       "   'description': \"About 4 feet long from head to tentacle tip, grindylows appear to be half-goblin and half-octopus, the split occurring at the waist. Grindylows are violent, ravenous creatures that use their spears to hunt or just to poke at things that scream and cry. While grindylows resemble goblins, they are not humanoid creatures. Nonetheless, these aquatic monsters are just as wicked as the most sadistic of goblins, and take immense pleasure in others' misfortunes and the spread of mayhem. Thanks to this twisted desire, grindylows have a nasty reputation among both other intelligent water-dwelling creatures and most land-dwelling beings. Grindylows eat whatever they can kill, giving them a rather wide selection of meals. High or low, no one is safe from the brutish assaults; tribes of merfolk have been overwhelmed by bands of grindylows, as have galleons full of experienced sailors. While obvious predators such as giant eels or sharks evoke great fear from grindylows, no enemies are more hated than the squid, be it common or giant. None are sure where this disdain stems from, but it is speculated that a squid is to an octopus for a grindylow what a dog is to a goblin dog for goblins. Incredibly fond of their similarly designed kin, grindylows believe octopuses to be the epitome of beauty, with squids being regarded as hideous freaks in comparison. There is no greater insult to a grindylow than being called a squid. While grindylows can take class levels to gain power, certain grindylows are freakish throwbacks to a primal age-these grindylows never cease growing, and in time can become massive beasts of Huge size. Unlike the typical grindylow, these giants can attack with all six of their tentacles and constrict with great effect. Giant grindylows are fortunately quite rare.\"},\n",

Gryphs normally survive on carrion and small animals, but take on larger game when driven by hunger or if they feel threatened. Most disturbing is their means of reproduction. Gryphs are hermaphroditic and mate frequently, such that their egg pouches are rarely empty. When they encounter a suitable host-a warm-blooded creature of size Small or larger, ideally alone-the gryphs swoop down, latch on to the target, and implant their eggs directly into its flesh. As long as the target is conscious, the flock continues its assault, though if the target flees the area, the gryphs return to their nest. The eggs quicken swiftly once implanted, and gryph chicks hatch forth mere minutes later in a bloody birth that is often fatal to the host. Gryphs have a strange affinity for vermin, often lairing in close proximity to one or more insect swarms or vermin of Medium size or smaller. The insects avoid the gryphs instinctively, feeding off the remains of the flock's meals and on creatures too small for the gryphs to bother with. Most gryphs have six legs, but some have four or even eight. Individual flocks are always made up of gryphs with the same number of limbs. A gryph is 3 feet tall and weighs 45 pounds.\"},\n",

Whether they were banished to the dark lands by ancient gods or the light-loving races they terrorized, or perhaps were brought to the deep realms by dark powers from some even more inhuman nightmare realm, is unknown, but gugs are loathed by other races for their carnal rites of slaughter. Gugs are 16 feet tall and weigh nearly 2,000 pounds, but they move with an eerie, unnatural gait as though their limbs contained far too many joints. They can contort and distend their limbs for greater reach or to wriggle easily through impossibly small passages. Gugs may cling for long hours to cave walls or just within dark side-caverns, lying in wait for prey to stumble too close. Their senses are keen, however, and their joy in the bloody hunt is considerable and gugs who catch the scent of blood may stalk their prey for long days, even venturing at times beyond their caves to dare the bright lands of the surface in search of tasty meat to drag back for their horrific sacrifices. Gugs are savage fighters when driven by a strong leader, but on their own may flee if brought to fewer than half their hit points, carrying off fresh meat for later feasting if they are able. They can subsist on fungi, slimes, and molds as well as carrion and even undead flesh-particularly that of ghouls. Some bloodthirsty gugs gain awful powers as gifts from their alien patrons. These monsters are known as savants. They have a Charisma of 18 and can use invisibility, spike stones, transmute rock to mud, and unholy blight once per day each as spell-like abilities (CL 10th, concentration +14).

       "   'description': 'The hellcat is a devious predator native to the fiery pits of Hell. While the hellcat is not a devil itself, it often acts as a guardian or mount for devils. Some might assume that hellcats serve devils as pets, but since hellcats are as intelligent as humans, they take offense to the idea that they might be anyone\\'s pet. On its own, a hellcat prefers to spend its time hunting and stalking prey. While the hellcat, as an outsider, need not eat to survive, it does enjoy eating for pleasure, often leaving significant portions of its kills behind for others to find. A hellcat that enters into an alliance with a devil is often used as a sort of hunter as a result. Human mortals can use spells like planar ally or planar binding to conjure hellcats for similar purposes. Those who do so are well advised to treat the hellcat with respect, for should any master prove too haughty with his hellcat or treat it as a dumb animal, the hellcat nurtures a lasting grudge. In such instances, the hellcat goes to great lengths to plan and coordinate revenge on the spellcaster, hoping to satisfy its own pride and to provide a lesson and example to all those who would deal with their kind. Though incapable of speech themselves, hellcats understand the Infernal tongue of their home plane, and can communicate by telepathy with any creature capable of speech. Hellcats are quick to retreat if they are clearly overmatched or up against foes they cannot reach, but they never forget prey that escapes them, and will often track potential victims and try to lead allies (including other hellcats) to them in order to make coordinated attacks or ambushes. The hellcat is only clearly visible in dim light, at these times appearing as a skeletal dire tiger with hellish flames burning and flickering along the surface of its bones. Despite this eerie appearance, the hellcat is neither undead nor an elemental creature. The \"fires\" are actually its blood coursing through transparent flesh. In bright light, the hellcat\\'s entire body fades away into obscurity, while in darkness its glowing blood is muted. Hellcats are as large as tigers, measuring 9 feet long and weighing 900 pounds.'},\n",

       "   'description': \"A hippocampus's scales vary in color from ivory to deep green to cerulean blue with shades of silver. Aquatic races such as merfolk and locathahs often train hippocampi as steeds or as draft animals used to pull cunningly designed underwater carriages. In the wild, hippocampi prefer to dwell in relatively shallow waters where their favorite food (seaweed and kelp) is more plentiful and larger predators are less common. These creatures often travel in large schools, analogous to free-roaming herds of wild horses on the surface world. The hippocampus is relatively easily trained-the amount of work and cost it requires is equivalent to what it takes to train a horse. As armor impacts the creature's swim speed, those who train hippocampi for war rarely bother to put barding on these creatures-when they do, they generally opt for the lightest armor, such as padded or leather barding. Mounted combat on a hippocampus is similar to fighting while riding a horse, although the hippocampus is a clumsy creature on land and cannot move at all out of the water if it has a rider weighing it down. Although a hippocampus has only two front legs, determine its carrying capacity as if it were a quadruped. Thus, a light load for a hippocampus is up to 228 pounds. Medium loads are up to 459 pounds, and heavy loads up to 690 pounds. A number of variant species of hippocampus exist, although the majority of these species differ from the creature presented here only in color and feat choice. Common feats other than Endurance for alternative hippocampus species are Great Fortitude, Improved Initiative, Iron Will, Lightning Ref lexes, Skill Focus (Swim), and Toughness. A few species of hippocampus are heartier and tougher all around-these creatures are generally those found in colder waters and are known as polar hippocampi. A polar hippocampus has the advanced creature simple template. Most impressive of all are hippocampi that dwell in the deeper seas. These creatures, known as giant hippocampi, are much larger-to generate stats for a giant hippocampus, advance the standard hippocampus to Huge size and increase its Hit Dice to 10. A giant hippocampus is CR 8.\"},\n",

       "   'description': \"The hippogriff bears the wings, forelegs, and head of a great raptor bird and the tail and body of a magnificent horse. As horses are a preferred meal for griffons, sages claim some flesh-warping wizard with an ironic sense of humor long ago created this unfortunate fusion of horse and hawk as a joke. A hippogriff 's feathers bear coloration similar to those of a hawk or an eagle; however, some breeders have managed to produce specimens with stark white or coal black feathers. A hippogriff 's torso and hind end are most often bay, chestnut, or gray, with some coats bearing pinto or even palomino coloration. Hippogriffs measure 11 feet long and weigh upward of 1,500 pounds. Territorial, hippogriffs fiercely protect the lands under their domain. Hippogriffs must also watch the skies for other predators, as they are a preferred meal of griffons, wyverns, and young dragons. Hippogriffs nest in sweeping grasslands, rugged hills, and flowing prairies. Exceptionally hardy hippogriffs make their home nestled into niches on canyon walls, from which they comb the rocky deserts for coyotes, deer, and the occasional humanoid. Hippogriffs prefer mammalian prey, yet they graze after every meal of flesh to aid their digestion. Their dietary habits can be dangerous to both ranchers and their livestock, so ranching communities often set bounties on them. Victims of these hunts are often taxidermied, and preserved hippogriffs frequently decorate frontier taverns and remote outposts. Far easier to train than griffons, yet easily as intelligent as horses, hippogriffs are trained as mounts by some elite companies of mounted soldiers, patrolling the skies and swooping down on unsuspecting enemies. Although they are magical beasts, if captured young, hippogriffs can be trained using Handle Animal as if they were animals. An adult hippogriff is more difficult to train, and attempts to do so follow the normal rules for training magical beasts using the skill. A hippogriff saddle must be specially crafted so as to not impact the movement of the creature's wings-these saddles are always exotic saddles. Hippogriffs lay eggs rather than birthing live young-as a general rule, a hippogriff nest only contains one egg at a time. A hippogriff 's egg is worth 200 gp, but a healthy young hippogriff is worth 500 gp. A fully trained hippogriff mount can command prices of up to 5,000 gp or more. A hippogriff can carry 198 pounds as a light load, 399 pounds as a medium load, and 600 pounds as a heavy load.\"},\n",

The howler prowls these Abyssal realms, serving the role of a hungry predator like a lion or tiger, save for the fact that the typical howler is much more intelligent than a big cat. Worse, howlers have little interest in eating their prey-they need not feed to live, but rather enjoy the process of stalking, mauling, and killing living creatures. In a way, the act of inflicting intense pain and madness upon mortal life is what fills a howler's life instead of the desire to feed. The howler's mane of razor-sharp quills makes it a poor choice of mount for most creatures, but it serves quite well as a guardian or sentinel-especially for outsiders, who may not enjoy the creature's constant howling, but aren't adversely affected by the supernatural sounds. When a howler sees prey, the tenor of its howls changes-howlers cannot speak, but they can use their howls to communicate quite a bit of information if required. They understand the Abyssal tongue, and when serving demons as guardians, their howls can not only alert their masters to the presence of intruders, but also to their number, appearance, and weaknesses. A howler is about the size of a tiger-12 feet from snout to tail and weighing 6,000 pounds. They are normally pale in color, with darker quills and milky eyes.\"},\n",

Found throughout the multiverse in courts and on battlefields, arbiters keep a close eye on the forces of chaos and do their best to keep the lawful from straying, while simultaneously winning over the hearts and minds of those who might yet be saved. Though their assorted abilities make them extremely useful, arbiters see themselves less as servants than as advisers and counselors, preferring to ride around on their summoners\\' shoulders and help guide their \"partners\" on the path of law. They detest being summoned by chaotic individuals, and when teamed with such a creature, they aren\\'t above using Diplomacy to try to inf luence the summoner\\'s friends or refusing to undertake actions that seem contrary to their programming. An arbiter who comes across evidence of a significant insurgence of chaos upon a given plane does everything in its power to rally its allies against the dangerous instability, and in situations that are clearly beyond its ability to handle, it may refuse to continue onward until the group agrees to help it reach the nearest greater inevitable and make a full report, or else may travel to Utopia itself and present its urgent information in person. Arbiters typically bear the shapes of tiny clockwork spheres with shiny metal wings. Generally peaceful unless combating true creatures of chaos, arbiters prefer to cast protection from chaos on their allies and use command to make opponents drop their weapons and run. Their most powerful weapon, the ability to release their internal energy as a deadly burst, is reserved for dire need and battles of the utmost service to law, as the resulting period of darkness while they\\'re powered down is the only thing that seems to truly scare the tiny automatons. An arbiter inevitable can serve a spellcaster as a familiar. Such a spellcaster must be lawful neutral, must be at least caster level 7th, and must have the Improved Familiar feat. Arbiter inevitables measure 1 foot in diameter but are surprisingly heavy, weighing 60 pounds. Their ability to fly on metal wings is as much a supernatural ability as a physical one.'},\n",

Perhaps because their missions can be the murkiest and most open to interpretation, kolyaruts are by far the most talkative of the inevitables, naturally possessing a courtly grace and an encyclopedic knowledge of social customs, which they use both to assist them in gathering information on their targets and in issuing challenges (or executing dignified sentences) on the battlefield.

Where a human would have legs, it instead possesses a complex orb of spinning rings similar in shape to an orrery-it is this whirling machine that grants the lhaksharut the ability to fly. Though a lhaksharut has huge, metal wings, they serve as little more than stabilizers when it's in flight. Four of the construct's arms end in functional hands that it normally uses to carry a mix of weapons. The lhaksharut's lower two arms hold large, flaming metal spheres in their hands-it uses these spheres to generate elemental bolts of energy that it can hurl great distances to damage foes. Lhaksharuts are tasked with maintaining the separation between different planes of reality, especially the elemental planes. They do not concern themselves with petty trespasses by visitors from one plane to another, nor even the occasional creation of a pocket plane or hijacking of a chunk of one reality to serve as a base within another. What does trouble a lhaksharut is anything that represents a permanent link between planes, or an effort by the denizens of one plane to invade and conquer another. They often find themselves in conf lict with the machinations of powerful outsiders who seek to create beachheads on other planes to serve as launching pads for massive incursions.\"},\n",

Rarely seeming to hurry, a marut's onslaught is deliberate, purposeful, and relentless. Its quarry may impede it or flee, running for decades or centuries, but from the initial meeting onward, the target must always look over its shoulder with the knowledge that, like death itself, the marut is ever at its heels, slowly but surely approaching, bringing balance through inevitable oblivion. Maruts primarily target those mortal souls who have artificially extended their lifespans beyond what is feasible for their race, such as liches and other powerful magic users. Extraordinary but natural means of cheating death are sometimes also punished, such as the magistrate who murders an entire starving town to save himself, or those who foresee their own deaths via divination magic and are therefore able to avoid them. Although they are capable of speaking eloquently in any language, and frequently gather vast amounts of information from those who are intimidated by their mere presence, maruts rarely engage in conversation or strategic alliances with mortals. Even on the battlefield, the juggernauts prefer to remain silent, knowing that their targets are already aware of their own transgressions and that all mortals secretly harbor dreams of immortality.\"},\n",

Rather, a zelekhut is content to enforce the laws of any given society, and while it might hunt a condemned serial killer or notorious thief across half a dozen planes, it will not shift a single hoof to capture a corrupt ruler whose offenses are 10 times worse, so long as the atrocities are within her technical rights as ruler.

       "   'description': 'The jabberwock is a true creature of legend-a subject of poetry, song, and myth in many cultures. It is known to be a devastating creature in combat whose arrival presages times of ruin and violence; these stories also tell of the creature\\'s fear of the tools some say were created in ancient times for the sole purpose of defeating them-vorpal weapons. A jabberwock is 35 feet tall and weighs 8,000 pounds. the Tane are presented in this book-the sard and the thrasfyr. None of the Tane are lower than CR 16 in power and all possess the planar acclimation special quality, but beyond that, they generally share no specific abilities or characteristics save for their common source in the primal world. When a jabberwock comes to the Material Plane, it does so to spread destruction and ruin. Typically, the monster seeks out a remote forest lair at least a day\\'s flight from civilization, then emerges from this den once a week to seek out a new place to destroy. It has no true interest in amassing treasure, but often gathers objects of obvious value to bring back to its den in order to encourage heroes to seek it out-to a jabberwock, it makes no difference whether it seeks out things to destroy or lets those things come to it. Jabberwocks age, eat, drink, and sleep like any living creature, but they do not reproduce in the classic sense of the word. The creation of a new jabberwock-or of any of the Tane, in fact-is regulated by the strange and unknowable godlike entities that dwell in the primeval world. These fey lords create new jabberwocks as they are needed-sometimes varying the exact particulars (see Variant Jabberwocks, below), but always creating a fully formed adult creature. No young jabberwock has ever been encountered as a result. The strange vulnerability a jabberwock possesses against vorpal weapons has long been a matter of intrigue and speculation among scholars. Most believe that, once upon a time, only one jabberwock existed, a creature of such great power that nothing could hurt it. Nothing, that is, save for a legendary sword forged for a mortal hero by a now-forgotten artisan or god. So epic was this battle that it created strange echoes throughout reality, and as a result, these echoes, in the form of the vorpal swords and jabberwocks known today, can be found on many worlds. VARIANT JABBERWOCKS The notion of a \"lesser\" jabberwock is something of a misnomer, for even these creatures are powerful foes. A lesser jabberwock is generally a CR 20 version of the typical jabberwock-you can achieve a creature of this power by lowering the typical jabberwock\\'s Hit Dice by 3 and by reducing its ability scores by 4 points each. Alternatively, you can apply the young creature simple template, but bear in mind that such a monster isn\\'t technically any younger than a typical jabberwock. As creatures from the primal world of the fey, some jabberwocks are as varied as the strange terrains and The jabberwock is not a creature of the Material Plane, but one from the primal world of the fey. It comes from a region of reality where life is more robust, where emotions are more potent, and where dreams and nightmares can come alive. Even in such incredible realms, though, the jabberwock is a creature to be feared. It belongs to a category of powerful creatures whose shapes and types run the gamut of possibility-a group known collectively as the \"Tane.\" Of the Tane, the jabberwock is said to be the most powerful, but the others in this grouping are far from helpless. Said to have been created as goliaths of war and madness, dreamt and stitched into being by the strange gods of this primeval reality, the Tane are as mysterious as they are powerful. Two other creatures of realms in that primal world, as if these environs have more to do with their manifestation than most scholars suspect. Generally, these changes simply alter the type of damage a jabberwock\\'s eye beams deal and the types of energy it is immune to. A jabberwock from a primeval glacial world would possess eye beams that deal cold damage, while a jabberwock from a storm-lashed world would deal electricity damage with its eye beams. If the nature of a jabberwock\\'s eye beams change, its burn ability changes to match, and it replaces its immunity to fire with immunity to the new energy type (while gaining resist fire 30 in place of the lost immunity to fire).'},\n",

Few, however, ever see a kelpie in its true form, for kelpies almost always encounter other creatures while in disguise as a humanoid, horse, or hippocampus, reverting to their true form only after their targets have drowned so that they can feast on their victims, leaving behind only the heart and liver (as both of these organs are distasteful to most kelpies). Kelpies can be found in saltwater and freshwater environments, including fens, rivers, swamps, and underground pools and lakes. Communities living near kelpie lairs believe that folk who die on the water or are killed by a kelpie become kelpies themselves. Kelpies may serve as steeds for aquatic fey or other water monsters while in their hippocampus forms, sometimes without their riders ever knowing the truth of the steed's sinister nature. A typical kelpie is 6 feet tall and weighs 170 pounds.\"},\n",

Their clothes usually have a large pocket or pouch to hold their belongings.

Combined with its strange, keening wail, this horrifying display is enough to paralyze prey and send formidable opponents running. Krenshar's retractable skin allows it to dine on carrion with a lower risk of picking up disease-carrying vermin, much like a vulture's bare head and neck. When the creature finishes eating, restoring the facial skin to its normal position scrapes off gore and clinging bugs. The ability to retract their skin is demonstrated in other contexts as well-male krenshars bare their skulls at rivals as a challenge over mates, females use this ability to ward off undesired suitors, and hunting adults use it to scare prey into ambushes. Though krenshars generally prefer to stalk herd animals like deer or cattle, they have no qualms about taking on humanoids when food is scarce. They average 4 to 5 feet in length and weigh approximately 175 pounds. Scholars have long debated the confusing nature of krenshar intelligence. While clearly more intelligent than mere animals, the creatures seem to lack all but the most rudimentary language of snarls and yowls, and aside from the scare tactics that make them notorious, tend to behave much like mundane cats or wolves, even going so far as to occasionally be befriended by rangers or druids. Those who deny krenshars' intelligence, however, need only look into their strange violet eyes or observe the ease with which they manipulate and outmaneuver their prey to realize their folly-an error few make twice.\"},\n",

Leprechauns love playing tricks on unknowing passersby-almost as much as they love a fine bottle of wine and a plateful of hot food in their bellies. They often steal something of worth from adventurers just to provoke a chase. Using their ability to disappear at will to its full potential, they wait until their victims appear to be about to give up the chase before reappearing once more to let the chase resume. They are not greedy creatures, and eventually drop what they've stolen, slipping away while their angry pursuers claim the lost property. The exception is gold-leprechauns love gold and often hoard it in secret, hidden places. It is rumored that a person who finds a gold coin in the forest and returns it to the leprechaun that dropped it will be granted a wish as a reward. Unfortunately, these rumors are false-likely perpetuated by the leprechauns themselves in order to trick others into bringing them gold. Leprechauns prefer not to kill other creatures unless the ones attacking them are malicious or known enemies of the forest or fey. They often use their powers to befuddle and annoy evil folk, tricking creatures such as goblins and orcs into thinking a forest is haunted.\"},\n",

Five feet tall at the shoulder, its tawny fur often coated with dried and clotted filth, the leucrotta is a powerful beast weighing over 800 pounds. The sharp bone ridges that line its oversized jaws instead of teeth are incredibly durable and, combined with massive jaw muscles, allow its bite to shear through bone and even steel. Leucrottas consume their prey gear and all; they vomit up what they cannot digest and pick through the debris in search of valuable items that might help them lure in prey. Leucrottas sometimes lead packs of gnolls, or even of their bestial cousins the crocottas (see below). They refuse to let themselves be used as beasts of burden, but sometimes allow favored gnoll companions to ride them into battle as steeds. The leucrotta in a gnoll pack generally thinks of itself as the leader of that group, and treats any established gnoll chieftain poorly in an attempt to goad that gnoll into attacking it. Those leucrottas that succeed in slaying a gnoll leader typically find it much easier to assume the role of tribal leader. Crocotta These degenerate offshoots of leucrottas have animallevel intelligence, but sense a kinship with leucrottas and obey them instinctively. Treat a crocotta as an advanced dire hyena with Improved Critical (bite) as a bonus feat. A crocotta looks similar to a leucrotta, save that it has shorter back legs, giving it a hunched, more hyena-like appearance. Leucrottas view crocottas with disdain and even shame, but it's not unusual to find these large hyena-like beasts in close proximity to a leucrotta pack. Crocottas are popular attractions in traveling carnivals, where unscrupulous con artists bill them as cursed humanoids or animals.\"},\n",

Locathahs possess scaly ochre skin tinged with green and yellow. Ridged, rust-colored skin covers their chests and stomachs, and a mottled wash of green, brown, and orange colors their fins like aging kelp. Locathahs exude a strong fishy odor when above water that, in addition to their already unnerving appearance, repulses most landdwellers. Despite this animosity, locathahs go to great lengths to befriend surface folk, offering safe passage through the waters, pointing out dangerous reefs, and hinting at sunken treasures in return for durable ceramics and metal tools and weapons, as well as tubers, which they view as a delicacy. These creatures dislike combat and flee when disarmed or outnumbered. Locathahs hold community in the highest regard, never leaving a friend behind and often going to great lengths to retrieve a fallen companion. Among their own kind and races friendly toward them, locathahs are social creatures who live a very human-like, albeit simple, lifestyle. Locathahs work in stone, coral, and bone to produce the crude implements they use. Some take coral work to obsessive levels, with certain clans taking generations to grow their preferred medium in its desired form before carving it. They feed on crustaceans, undersea plants, and shellfish, and rarely on large fish that are caught during ritualized hunts. Locathah matriarchs serve their undersea tribes not only as chieftains, but also as the primary egg layers of the community. Each adult member of the tribe is responsible for raising a single young locathah as his or her own. Locathahs tame moray eels, keeping them near their lairs as humans keep dogs. Some locathah soldiers and hunting groups use giant moray eels as mounts, chasing down their quarry and attacking with narrow-tipped spears. More powerful aquatic races use locathahs as slaves, abducting breeding matriarchs to produce a constant wave of new workers. Locathah stand roughly as tall as humans, yet their fins jut out, giving them an imposing stature. Lean and strong, locathahs weigh roughly 160 pounds.\"},\n",

Creatures of the light, lurkers are visible only in dim illumination, with anything brighter than a flickering torch making them completely invisible, even as they savage their enemies-a prospect terrifying to those civilized races that equate light with safety. A lurker in light turns conventional wisdom on its head, for they detest darkness and the creatures that dwell in it, yet they themselves are sadistic and evil. They particularly hate darkmantles, dwarves, and creatures from the Plane of Shadow, and given the time, they enjoy torturing such creatures to death if they can capture them alive.

Though by far the most benign of common lycanthropes, werebears are shunned by most normal folk, who fear and mistrust their animal transformations. Most live as recluses in forested areas or in small family units among their own kind. They avoid confrontations with strangers but do not hesitate to drive evil humanoids out of their territory. Some werebears are angry and violent, because of either temperament or a lifetime of harassment from others, and these mean ones aren't afraid to put an axe in a trespasser's face or eat someone who pushes them too far. Cool-headed werebears don't like to speak of these individuals with strangers.\"},\n",

A typical magma ooze grows to 10 feet across and is about 6 inches thick. VARIANT MAGMA OOZES Differing types of molten stone and the nature of the magic that created them can inf luence what types of magma ooze form. Brimstone: Inf luenced by fiendish energy, brimstone magma oozes stink of evil, and the patterns of cooled stone and hot lava on their surfaces resemble tortured or demonic faces. They have the fiendish creature simple template. Crystalline: Formed from rock densely laced with rare minerals, crystalline magma oozes have hot gases trapped within their bodies. Striking a crystalline magma ooze with a non-reach melee weapon causes this gas to erupt, dealing 1d6 points of fire damage to the attacking creature. Poisonous: Whether from toxic metals or magical contamination, these oozes are deadly poison in addition to mobile burning death. A poisonous ooze is +1 CR.

       "   'description': \"A mandragora rises spontaneously from a mandrake root that has drawn nutrition from the corpse or ichor of a demon. A typical mandragora stands at just over 3 feet tall and only weighs 30 pounds. However, its size hides the creature's fantastic strength and brutality. When a mandragora attacks, its fingers grow into whipping, thorny vines nearly 10 feet long, with which it makes its slam attacks. A mandragora rarely strays far from its lair amid tangled roots or vines, but when it encounters any other creature, it attacks regardless of the odds. However, a mandragora can usually recognize druids and does not attack them or their animal companions unless they attack it first. It has no qualms about attacking a druid's allies. When mandragora poison is mixed with its thick, gooey, sap-like blood and 1,000 gp worth of alchemical reagents, the resulting fluid can be used as a focus for the scrying spell. The fluid only lasts for the duration of the spell's casting time and resulting effects but the subject of the spell takes a -4 penalty on the save to resist it. A mandrake root that is growing on or near a demon's corpse or ichor has a 2% chance of awakening as a mandragora within a day of first absorbing the tainted material. A creature that wants to create a mandragora can do so with alchemy; the process requires a day of work, a mandrake root, several pints of ichor or the body of a demon of CR 6 or above, and a successful DC 25 Craft (alchemy) check.

They prefer to bargain and haggle rather than to fight, but because they wander the planes seeking and trading magical goods, they typically travel with an entourage of hired bodyguards. Mercanes are capable of defending themselves, and often carry masterwork Large falchions. Yet these weapons are primarily for show, as mercanes prefer to let their bodyguards deal with violent opponents. If a situation turns ugly, mercanes typically use their magical abilities to flee, abandoning their hirelings if necessary. Mercanes are known throughout the planes as traders in magical items. Each has a secret chest filled with wares stashed away, ready to be pulled out when it's time to haggle and close a deal (or to bribe a potential obstacle). Mercanes are therefore not easily robbed, and they only surrender the contents of a secret chest when they have no other choice. Mercanes have no interest in mundane goods, no matter how fine or rare. Only magical objects earn their attention and their coin. They're known for driving hard, but fair, bargains, and for hiring adventurers from time to time to recover certain goods of interest for a fair price. Although they are not particularly brave, they hold contracts sacrosanct and keep their agreements. Rumors and legends abound as to the origins of the mercanes and their reasons for seeking out and buying magical items. Their home plane is unknown, and they have wandered between the worlds for as long as any can recall. Stories claim the mercanes feed on the magic items they acquire, or even need them in order to reproduce. There are also tales of a war in a far corner of the planes, with the mercanes serving the roles of arms merchants, aggressors, or defenders, depending on who tells the story. Mercanes are 10 feet tall and weigh 500 pounds.\"},\n",

Although their green, scaled skin and webbed hands and feet make them appear different, merrows are just as cruel, savage, and wicked as their ogre relatives. The saltwater variety grows much larger than the freshwater variety, but the behavior and society of the two types are otherwise similar. Merrows are known for pillaging small fishing villages and towns under cover of night. Similar to ogres, merrows have a strong sense of family and typically hunt in gangs, preferring to grab a couple of villagers and head back into the water rather than sticking around and dealing with armed resistance. Merrows have a stronger sense of unity than ogres do, and rarely will the leader of a tribe be challenged. When they have chosen a village or town to plunder, they attack as a gang and share the spoils. A freshwater merrow is 12 feet tall and weighs 500 pounds. Saltwater merrows easily reach 20 feet tall and 4,000 pounds, and have been known to hunt whales. The two species do not often come in contact, but when they do, feuding and conf lict are swift to develop.'},\n",

Although their green, scaled skin and webbed hands and feet make them appear different, merrows are just as cruel, savage, and wicked as their ogre relatives. The saltwater variety grows much larger than the freshwater variety, but the behavior and society of the two types are otherwise similar. Merrows are known for pillaging small fishing villages and towns under cover of night. Similar to ogres, merrows have a strong sense of family and typically hunt in gangs, preferring to grab a couple of villagers and head back into the water rather than sticking around and dealing with armed resistance. Merrows have a stronger sense of unity than ogres do, and rarely will the leader of a tribe be challenged. When they have chosen a village or town to plunder, they attack as a gang and share the spoils. A freshwater merrow is 12 feet tall and weighs 500 pounds. Saltwater merrows easily reach 20 feet tall and 4,000 pounds, and have been known to hunt whales. The two species do not often come in contact, but when they do, feuding and conf lict are swift to develop.'},\n",

When they come to the Material Plane, they prefer to inhabit dank dungeon corridors, abandoned ruins, and the forgotten corridors of lost civilizations. Scholars dispute what drives the ambitions of these creatures, or even what they seek on the Material Plane, but all agree that they are deadly combatants and merciless hunters. Their semi-solid bodies appear to be composed of a strange, white smoke, and they can shape their vaporous bodies at will to seep through small cracks and openings in pursuit of prey. When attacking, they coalesce the tips of their misty tentacles into wickedly barbed talons, slashing at opponents with these razor-sharp appendages. Mihstus rely on their insubstantial nature to close with opponents quickly, engulfing the nearest threat while continuing to attack any who seek to deprive them of their chosen victim. When a mihstu manages to embrace a foe with its body, it drains away the creature's vital fluids at an alarming rate. These fluids churn in the creature's body for a few rounds before spattering against nearby walls or on the floor-the mihstu seems to gain no nourishment from these fluids, so this attack may be nothing more than a favorite method of cruelty. Mihstus are immortal unless slain by violence, and if properly bargained with, these deadly outsiders can actually be intriguing sources of information. Mihstus are normally interested in little more than stalking and consuming prey, and as a result only tend to provide reliable information or cooperate when supplied with intriguing victims to pursue and destroy. Nefarious creatures such as rakshasas and evil cloud giants often utilize mihstus as trackers and assassins, or sometimes employ them as guards in the forgotten corridors of their lairs.\"},\n",

       "   'description': \"Despite their monstrous appearances, mongrelmen are generally hardworking and peaceful creatures. A mongrelman can produce offspring with any humanoid, mixing bloodlines in strange ways to create hardier crossbreeds. No two mongrelmen look the same. One may have a face that is half hobgoblin, half lizardfolk, with one human-like foot and one cloven hoof, while his sister may have elven ears, a dwarven beard, orc tusks, and clawed hands. Each mongrelman usually has characteristics from at least a half-dozen different races. This strange mixture enforces mongrelmen's place in the edges of the world, for they are shunned by all who fear their twisted appearance. Mistaken as enemies by all, mongrelmen prefer to be left alone. Most mongrelmen live below the surface of the world in hidden caves far from civilization. These creatures pride themselves on their survival skills, for the bowels of the earth are no place for weaklings. Other foul and intelligent races who claim dominion in the underworld take mongrelmen as slaves (particularly morlocks), finding this deformed race's docile nature and hardworking attitude makes them extremely useful as tools of labor. In this role, mongrelmen still fall back on their pride of survival, slow to rebel and patiently waiting for the overthrow of their masters. Mongrelmen dwelling on the surface sometimes live amid the hustle and bustle of cities, sequestering themselves in ghettos and sewers to avoid notice. Urban mongrelmen may rely on begging and pickpocketing to get by, but most form rural communities near trading routes. Despite their varied physical forms, most mongrelmen average 5-6 feet tall and weigh between 150 and 250 pounds on average. A tragically short lifespan limits the creatures' population growth-mongrelmen rarely live past 35 years.\"},\n",

Mu spores are more than just ravenous eaters of nations-they possess uncommon intellects, and if peaceful contact can be made, their knowledge can be quite valuable.

Rather, it is a magical construct built from the skeleton of a giant snake and then mounted with the skull of a humanoid creature. Fangs are cemented into the jaws of the skull, after which the entire creation can be brought to life by a series of obscure and expensive rituals-these rituals are traditionally well guarded by those who discover them. As a mindless construct that requires neither food nor sleep, a necrophidius makes an excellent guardian, and its innate stealth allows it to slip up on the unwary undetected. In certain areas, the necrophidius is commonly employed as an assassin, able to disable its quarries with its dance of death or paralyzing bite before disposing of them in a gruesome manner-as long as the assassination doesn't require any particular intelligence to carry out. Particularly macabre creators might even construct the creature from the skull of a friend or loved one of the intended victim in order to magnify the horror of the assassination, leaving much of the flesh on the skull so the victim can recognize its source. This flesh rots eventually-only freshly crafted necrophidiuses have this grisly feature (although regular applications of gentle repose spells can keep such a morbid decoration fresh for a much longer period of time). Although a necrophidius is mindless, it can follow the simple commands of its creator. These can include commands to lie dormant until some specific condition is met or to follow and kill an indicated target to the exclusion of all other activities. A typical necrophidius is 10 feet long and weighs 200 pounds. Construction A necrophidius's body consists of a human skull and the skeletal remains of a constrictor snake, all treated with rare oils and powders worth 1,000 gp.

These nightshades are also the most likely to be found serving a non-undead master-nightwings are often used by powerful mortals as guardians or sentinels. Despite this, nightwings still hope to someday slay any master they serve. They enter servitude primarily as a method of aiding a destructive or murderous mortal in their task of mass murder; once this task is over, or if at any point the nightwing believes its master is slacking in its murderous duties, the nightwing is swift to turn on its one-time ally. A nightwing found on the Material Plane not in the employ of a more powerful master is typically encountered in rugged terrain where there are numerous locations that can provide shelter when the sun rises. The monsters prefer caves and abandoned buildings for this purpose. A nightwing's body is 20 feet long, but its wingspan is 80 feet. It weighs 4,500 pounds.\"},\n",

Special Qualities and Defenses: An ogrekin gains lowlight vision. In addition, ogrekin receive two random deformities-one beneficial and one disadvantageous. Beneficial Deformities: The ogrekin gains one of these, chosen randomly. 1: Oversized Limb: The ogrekin can wield weapons one size category larger than normal without any penalty and gains a +2 bonus to its Strength. 2: Oversized Maw: The ogrekin gains a bite attack (1d4). 5: Quick Metabolism: The ogrekin gains a +2 racial bonus on Fortitude saves. 4: Thick Skin: Improve natural armor bonus by +2. 5: Vestigial Limb: Vestigial third arm (can\\'t be used to use items) grants a +4 racial bonus on grapple checks. 6: Vestigial Twin: A malformed twin\\'s head juts out from the ogrekin, providing the ogrekin with all-around vision. Disadvantageous Deformities: The ogrekin gains one of these, chosen randomly. 1: Deformed Hand: One hand can\\'t wield weapons; -2 penalty on attack rolls with two-handed weapons. 2: Fragile: The ogrekin is particularly frail and gaunt. It loses its +4 racial bonus to Con. 3: Light Sensitive: The ogrekin gains light sensitivity. 4: Obese: The ogrekin takes a -2 penalty to Dexterity (minimum score of 1). 5: Stunted Legs: The ogrekin\\'s base speed is reduced by 10 feet (minimum base speed of 5 feet). 6: Weak Mind: The ogrekin\\'s head is huge and misshapen.

Some sought refuge in seemingly safer tunnels nearer the surface. The unspeakable horrors they encountered there transformed them into derros over the course of several generations. Those pechs that stayed close to their ancestral caverns survive to this day, though in such small numbers and in such isolation that few of the surface world know of their existence. Pechs are skilled miners and stonemasons, and are at times employed or enslaved as such by other subterranean races. They have learned to hide the entrances to their lairs most carefully, blending their narrow entranceways into the living rock such that they can only be seen from exactly the right angle. When interlopers do find a pech's lair, they are met with open arms, friendly advice, and a firm insistence that the pech is to be left alone. The typical pech stands only 3-1/2 feet tall, but its dense flesh gives it a weight of 100 pounds.\"},\n",

       "   'description': \"Savage creatures of nightmare, perytons combine the features of stags, wolves, and great birds of prey. Though vicious beasts, perytons possess all the intelligence of a human. Perytons hunt any creature weaker than themselves, but prefer humanoid prey, as they particularly relish the taste of such creatures' still-beating hearts. Perytons loathe all other creatures, even their own kind, and adult male perytons often attack one another on sight. However, strong females sometimes lead small family flocks composed of the alpha female, two or three weaker females, and up to six fledglings. The flock drives off males when they come of age, but females are allowed to join the pack when they mature, provided they swear allegiance to the alpha female. Unpaired males frequently attack such flocks in the hope of making off with a mate; failing that, they approach more peacefully, with offers of warm humanoid hearts (or even still-living victims) to attract females. Perytons mate once per year. The mating ritual is short, brutal, and in the end often fatal for the male. Afterward, the female lays a single, foot-tall black egg, which hatches 7 months later. A peryton is 4 feet in length with a wingspan of 11 feet. It weighs 250 pounds.\"},\n",

       "   'description': 'Petitioners are the souls of mortals brought to the Outer Planes after death in order to experience their ultimate punishment, reward, or fate. A petitioner retains fragments of its memories from life, and its appearance depends not only upon the shape it held in life but also upon the nature of the Outer Plane to which it has come. The stat block detailed above presents a typical petitioner formed from the soul of an average human-it does not include any of the plane-specific abilities or features a petitioner gains, and should be modified as appropriate depending on the plane to which the petitioner is assigned. Creatures who die, become petitioners, and then return to life retain no memories of the time they spent as petitioners in the afterlife. A petitioner who dies is gone forever-its \"life force\" has either returned to the Positive Energy Plane or, in some cases, provided the energy to trigger the creation of another outsider. Petitioners who please a deity or another powerful outsider can be granted rewards-the most common such reward manifests as a transformation into a different outsider, such as an archon, azata, demon, or devil, depending upon the petitioner\\'s alignment. In rare cases, a creature can retain its personality from life all the way through its existence as a petitioner and into its third \"life\" as an outsider, although such events are rare indeed. Creating a Petitioner \"Petitioner\" is an acquired template that can be added to any creature whose soul migrates to one of the Outer Planes following its death (henceforth referred to as the base creature). The petitioner uses all of the base creature\\'s statistics and abilities except as noted below. CR: A petitioner\\'s CR is 1. In some cases, at the GM\\'s discretion, particularly large or unusual petitioners with higher than normal ability scores may begin with a higher CR; compare the petitioner\\'s statistics to the values on Table 1-1 on page 293 to help determine an unusual petitioner\\'s starting CR. Alignment: A petitioner\\'s alignment is identical to that of its home plane. Size and Type: The creature\\'s type changes to outsider. It loses all subtypes. Its size does not change. Senses: Petitioners lose any unusual senses they had, but gain darkvision 60 feet. Armor Class: The petitioner loses all racial bonuses to its Armor Class. Hit Dice: Petitioners lose all racial and class-based Hit Dice and gain 2d10 racial Hit Dice as outsiders. Saves: Petitioners have good Fortitude and Ref lex saves; a petitioner\\'s base saves are Fort +3, Ref +3, Will +0. Defensive Abilities: Petitioners lose all the defensive abilities of the base creature. Petitioners are immune to mind-affecting effects. Attacks: The creature\\'s BAB is +2, subject to modification for size and Strength. It loses all natural attacks and gains a slam attack as appropriate for a creature of its size. Special Attacks: Petitioners lose all special attacks. Abilities: Same as the base creature. Feats: Petitioners lose all feats. As a 2 HD outsider, a petitioner gains one feat-typically Toughness. Skills: Petitioners lose all skill ranks they possessed as mortals. As a 2 HD outsider, a petitioner has 12 skill ranks it can spend on skills (with a maximum of 2 ranks in any one skill), and gains bonus skill ranks as appropriate for its Intelligence. Unlike most outsiders, petitioners do not gain an additional 4 class skills beyond those available to all outsiders. Special Qualities: Petitioners lose all special qualities, along with all abilities granted by class levels (including increases on saving throws and to HD and BAB). Petitioner Traits A petitioner gains additional traits based on its home plane. Abaddon (Neutral Evil): The \"hunted\" have bodies that are identical to what they had in life-these petitioners are doomed to be stalked and eventually consumed by the daemons that lust for souls. A hunted that survives long enough eventually warps and twists into a daemon. The hunted gain DR 5/-and fast healing 1 so that they provide a slightly more robust hunt for their daemonic predators. Abyss (Chaotic Evil): \"Larvae\" are perhaps the most hideous of petitioners-they appear as pallid, maggotlike creatures with heads similar to those they possessed in life. Larvae that feed long enough on Abyssal filth eventually transform into demons. They have cold, electricity, and fire resistance 10, and instead of a slam attack gain a bite attack as appropriate for their size. Elysium (Chaotic Good): The \"chosen\" have idealized versions of their mortal bodies. In time, after experiencing the pleasures Elysium has to offer, the chosen become azatas. The chosen gain resistance to cold and fire 10 and a +2 bonus to Charisma. Heaven (Lawful Good): The \"elect\" appear similar to their mortal forms, save that they possess a golden halo and feathered wings. After spending enough time aiding heavenly tasks, the elect become archons. They gain a fly speed equal to their base speed (average mobility). Hell (Lawful Evil): The \"damned\" retain their mortal forms, but are heavily scarred by various tortures. Those who endure the torments of Hell long enough may eventually be approved for transformation into devils. The damned gain immunity to fire (but not immunity to the pain caused by fire-whenever one of the damned takes fire damage, it must make a DC 15 Fortitude save to resist being stunned by the pain for 1d4 rounds). Limbo (Chaotic Neutral): The \"shapeless\" retain their basic forms, but these forms constantly waver and shimmer, as if they were ghosts in peril of dissolving away. After wallowing in the chaos of Limbo for long enough, they can transform into proteans. The shapeless have the incorporeal subtype, and all advantages granted by that defensive ability. Nirvana (Neutral Good): The \"cleansed\" take on the forms of animals that closely approximate their personalities. Upon achieving true enlightenment, they transform into agathions. The cleansed gain cold and sonic resistance 10 and a +2 bonus to Wisdom. Purgatory (Neutral): The \"dead\" appear as animated skeletons but are not undead-in time, they can earn the right to become aeons. They gain DR 10/bludgeoning and immunity to cold. Utopia (Lawful Neutral): The \"remade\" retain the same body shape but have milky white skin covered in dense black script, as if some strange scribe had used them for parchment. Upon deciphering the riddles posed by these complex lines of script, one of the remade can enter an axiomite forge to be transformed into an inevitable. The remade are immune to hostile transmutation effects and gain a +2 bonus to Intelligence.'},\n",

       "   'description': 'Typically found in damp dungeons, refuse heaps, and forgotten, filthy chambers, phycomids are dangerous fungoid creatures that grow in small, steaming patches among decomposing organic matter. The phycomid\\'s main body is a mass of green-brown mold that can slither and move when necessary to seek out new carrion to feed upon. Numerous mushrooms sprout from the main body-vile green stalks topped with purple or red caps that seem to steam with rank-smelling smoke. This smoke is in fact vapor escaping from the numerous globs of acid the plant produces as a method of both self-defense and reproduction. This acidic substance is expelled from the phycomid whenever it senses movement nearby, and seasoned adventurers can often trick a phycomid into giving away its true nature by simulating movement within range of the fungus. Less fortunate encounters are typically marked by large infestations of phycomids growing among a scattered collection of dead bodies. Because of the filthy environment in which this fungus thrives, goblins are one of the few races that have learned to coexist with phycomids. Not content to simply give the fungi a wide berth, these foolish goblins actually harvest the phycomids, prodding them into positions in their warrens where they can serve as guards and sentinels, utilizing long poles they call \"slime sticks\" or placing delicious-smelling carrion to attract the fungus to a desired position. Although phycomids are deadly to eat, many goblin tribes view those who eat a phycomid mushroom and survive as great heroes. Needless to say, most goblin lairs that attempt to utilize phycomids as guardians eventually become nothing more than phycomid lairs-a goblin tribe\\'s luck can only hold up for so long, after all.'},\n",

The poltergeist experiences great trauma over its condition; this trauma twists its psyche to evil and fosters an overall hatred of the living expressed in outbursts of rage. A poltergeist is bound to a specific place, usually a building, room, or recognizable area (a section of a cemetery, a stretch of lonely road, and so on).

       "   'description': 'Debate rages as to whether or not the strange and capricious creatures called voidworms are actually proteans at all. To the wizards and sorcerers who summon them as familiars, the answer seems obvious-these tiny dwellers of Limbo have all the requisite racial traits of proteans, down to their serpentine shapes. Yet the established protean castes find such claims outright insulting, claiming instead that it is such acts of conjuration that call voidworms forth from the raw stuff of Limbo, giving them shape and life according to the spellcasters\\' expectations, and that these lesser beings are but pale ref lections of their formidable kin. Voidworms themselves have little to say on the matter-creatures of the moment, and sparing little thought for the constantly mutable concept of \"reality,\" voidworms only barely grasp cause and effect, and the past has no more substance or signif icance for them than a dream. In order to gain a voidworm as a familiar, a spellcaster must be chaotic neutral, be caster level 7th, and have the Improved Familiar feat. Regardless of their actual origins, voidworms maintain a thriving Ecology in the chaos of Limbo, forming together into darting, flashing schools that are often hunted for sport by naunets and other predators of chaos. Mortal wizards, however, most commonly encounter voidworms as summoned familiars. These tiny, serpentine creatures are particularly valued by illusionists, evokers, and other magical practitioners who deal with distorting or molding reality, though the familiars\\' bizarre logic and miniscule attention spans sometimes make them more trouble than they\\'re worth. Still, their confusing attack and remarkable hardiness have saved more than one wizard on the battlef ield, and their strange thought processes can sometimes offer unique insights in the laboratory. When traveling in more mundane lands, wizards often order voidworm familiars to use their change shape ability to disguise themselves as ordinary pets or animal familiars, though these disguises tend to slip when the voidworm grows curious or playful. A voidworm is only 2 feet long and weighs a mere 2 pounds. No two voidworms are exactly alike in their coloration or markings. Their two feathery wings generally take on brighter colors than the rest of their bodies, and in the case of voidworms conjured as familiars, these \"wings\" are the same color as their masters\\' eyes.'},\n",

Yet the augnagar's favorite feast is of a much more cannibalistic type. These creatures find the flesh of their own kind to be the greatest delicacy. When an augnagar feeds upon enough of its own kind, it grows enormously bloated such that it can no longer fly, at which point it uses its clawed tails to tear its body apart in a frenzy of self-destruction. From this storm of torn fat and shredded viscera emerges a fully grown thulgant qlippoth-a creature similar in shape to an augnagar, yet much more intelligent and even more dangerous.

The fungus transforms the host corpse in hideous ways, adding legs or rearranging features-a rat might gain an extra pair of legs and an insectoid visage, while a cat could lose all its legs and fur and gain a snake-like body. The only thing that all cythnigots have in common is a long stalk of fungal material that extends up from the creature's body, ending in a surprisingly strong set of fanged jaws. A cythnigot without a host body appears as little more than a foul-smelling puff ball the size of a human's fist. Chaotic evil spellcasters of caster level 7th who have the Improved Familiar feat can gain a cythnigot as a familiar-to do so, the spellcaster must already have a Tiny animal as a familiar. Infusing this familiar with the spores results in a cythnigot that is a loyal, if rather disgusting, minion of the spellcaster. A cythnigot is about 20 inches long and weighs 10 pounds.\"},\n",

       "   'description': 'The most terrible of the qlippoth, with the exception of the qlippoth lords, is doubtless the immense iathavos. Believed by many to be a singular entity, a unique qlippoth so abhorrent that even the Abyss cannot bear to allow more than one to exist at any one time, the iathavos is often encountered attended by numerous nyogoth qlippoth that squirm over its body or under its bulk, feeding upon the wastes and fragments left behind by its shuddersome passing. These nyogoths are invariably other creatures that the iathavos has absorbed and remade-they represent one of the most heinous fates that could await would-be explorers of the deepest Abyssal rifts. The iathavos crusades against the demonic scourge, but the monster does not limit its attentions to seeking out and destroying demons in preparation for the return of the Abyss to qlippoth rule. Indeed, the iathavos has the ability to shift among the various planes of the multiverse, and often travels to Material Plane worlds to systematically scour realms clean of mortal life, thus ensuring that these worlds can no longer provide the raw materials-sinful mortal souls-the Abyss relies upon to create new demons. Worlds visited by the iathavos are notable for the widespread devastation and the unusually large populations of nyogoths that remain behind to consume every last speck of decay the iathavos leaves behind. The iathavos can be called via the most powerful spells, such as gate, but its immunity to mind-affecting effects and its vast size ensure that only the most desperate or most insane ever attempt such a self-destructive act. In all known cases, the deliberate conjuration of the iathavos to another world has done little more than draw the attention of the powerful creature to that world, so that even if it is banished back to the Abyss before it can cause too much devastation, the iathavos remembers the visit. It often returns under its own power at a later date to pursue its own goals on the newly discovered world. Only if the iathavos is presented with defenders that prevent it from achieving its destructive ruin does it flee back to the Abyss via plane shift-in such cases, the qlippoth often waits for centuries or even millennia before returning to that world, for there are always easier realms to destroy. The iathavos is a powerful and horrifying monster made all the more devastating by its incredible intellect. The creature takes care to plan its major assaults on demonic enclaves or mortal cities, even though it is powerful enough that few creatures in the multiverse can give it pause. When the iathavos is slain, the multiverse typically has only a relatively short time before the Abyss births a replacement monstrosity for the defeated qlippoth. This newly born iathavos is an entirely new creature-it does not share the memories of the previous incarnation, nor does it possess any advanced hit dice or class levels the previous monster may have gained, yet its appetite and hatred for demonic life and the sins that create such life remain constant and unending. To call such an iathavos a \"newborn\" is somewhat misleading. Although technically a freshly created creature, newborn iathavoses do not undergo a \"childhood.\" They form fully grown, as presented here. Yet with each new incarnation of the qlippoth monstrosity, changes can occur. A new iathavos might have slightly different spell-like abilities, for example, or the nature of its horrific appearance might change from that presented here. As an iathavos continues to hunt and destroy, it grows more powerful-an advanced iathavos typically gains more racial Hit Dice as a result. An iathavos that gains power by taking class levels is not unheard of, but it is quite rare-most who do take levels in sorcerer.'},\n",

Essentially mobile clumps of buoyant intestines, these writhing creatures squirt through the air in convulsive movements like an octopus gliding through water, and are constantly on the search for anything smaller than one of their many mouths (either the relatively small ones that pinch and gasp at the tips of their intestinal limbs or the larger gaping one at their cores). They can subsist on the waste and filth left behind by other denizens of the Abyss, but particularly enjoy feeding on still-living creatures. Despite their seemingly lowly role in Abyssal ecosystems, the nyogoths are far from stupid beasts. Most are nearly as intelligent as the average human, and are capable of solving relatively complex problems when it comes to securing the next meal. As outsiders, nyogoths do not need to eat to survive, yet this does not exempt them from hunger-a nyogoth that goes for longer than 12 hours without a meal becomes increasingly violent and erratic. Such a \"starving\" nyogoth typically fights to the death when the prospect of food is available, and may even resort to self-cannibalism, drinking its own spurting digestive juices from its wounds in a nauseating display. A typical nyogoth is 5 feet in diameter and weighs 260 pounds, although they are known to grow much larger.'},\n",

These malicious fey creatures delight in striking with blinding speed and accuracy, often killing their victims without ever fully revealing themselves; the victim simply spurts blood and falls over dead, with no witnesses to the quickling's deed. Though related to brownies and grigs, quicklings share none of their kin's generosity or merriment, choosing instead to live a life of cruelty and viciousness. Quicklings pride themselves on insults and brutality, and frequently stalk and harass their quarry until the victim gives up the chase. While quicklings are naturally invisible when motionless, they rarely contain themselves, and bob and twitch while standing and talking to other creatures. Quicklings hate every other race of creature, particularly elves, gnomes, and other kinds of fey. They barely tolerate their own kind, and rarely work together for longer than a few weeks. Quicklings stand just over 2-1/2 feet tall and weigh 15 pounds.\"},\n",

       "   'description': \"Hailing from the barren wastes of the Plane of Fire, the rast is as dangerous as it is bizarre. Its body is a single tumorous sack that bulges with hidden organs and veins and bears no sensory apparatus beyond two miniscule eyes almost lost in the folds and wattles of its flesh. Instead, its defining feature is a mouth of flesh-ripping teeth and a wriggling mass of tangled legs. The exact number of legs on a particular rast is seemingly a random trait. Strangely, these tangled limbs do not support the creature, but rather hang twitching and waving beneath it as the rast floats through the air with an easy grace, only reaching out to manipulate objects or-more often-to slash at its prey. Though rasts do not appear to have any spoken language, they display a degree of intelligence that places them above mere animals, and use this innate cunning to aid in their hunts. As prey is scarce in the barren, ashy deserts of the Plane of Fire where they make their home, rasts prefer to hunt in packs, swarming through the skies like schools of fish, their movements precise and coordinated despite their thrashing limbs. When they come across a likely target, they descend en masse, paralyzing those foes susceptible to their gaze and then abandoning them temporarily to focus on any opponents that remain mobile and dangerous, slashing with their claws and latching on with thick-lipped mouths to suck their victims' blood and viscera. Though each rast has roughly a dozen limbs, it can only control up to four at any given time, leaving the others to dangle uselessly. Rasts make their homes in small ashen burrows, no more than holes scooped out by the thrashing of their claws, and bear their squirming young live. An adult rast is the size of a human and weighs 200 pounds. Rasts tend to be red, yellow, or purple, with darker coloration on their legs and heads, the better to blend in with the fiery plains of their homeland. Though most other intelligent species on the Plane of Fire are powerful enough (or wise enough) to avoid direct conf lict with a rast pack, a cluster that stumbles through a portal to the Material Plane (or perhaps more tragically, is summoned to the Material Plane by a foolish spellcaster) can prove disastrous for the local ecosystem, consuming everything in its path with seemingly no limit to its repulsive hunger.\"},\n",

       "   'description': 'Most evil dragons spend their lifetimes coveting and amassing wealth, but when the end draws near, some come to realize that all the wealth in the world cannot forestall death. Faced with this truth, most dragons vent their frustration on the countryside, ravaging the world before their passing. Yet some seek a greater solution to the problem and decide instead to linger on, hoarding life as they once hoarded gold. These foul wyrms attract the attention of dark powers, and through the blackest of necromantic rituals are transformed into undead dragons known as raveners. Although its body quickly rots away, a ravener does not care for the needs of the flesh. It seeks only to consume life, be it from wild animals, would-be dragonslayers, or even other dragons. A ravener is often on the move, changing lairs frequently as its territories become devoid of life. The ravener presented here is built from a red dragon wyrm. See page 98 of the Pathfinder RPG Bestiary for rules on this monster\\'s fire aura, manipulate flames, melt stone, and smoke vision abilities. Creating a Ravener \"Ravener\" is an acquired template that can be added to any evil true dragon of an age category of ancient or older (referred to hereafter as the base creature). A ravener retains all the base creature\\'s statistics and special abilities except as noted here. CR: Same as the base creature +2. Alignment: Any evil. Type: The creature\\'s type changes to undead. Do not recalculate BAB, saves, or skill ranks. It keeps any subtypes possessed by the base creature. Senses: A ravener\\'s darkvision increases to 240 feet, and its blindsense increases to 120 feet. Armor Class: A ravener gains a def lection bonus to its AC equal to half its Charisma bonus (minimum +1). Hit Dice: Change all of the base creature\\'s racial Hit Dice to d8s. All Hit Dice derived from class levels remain unchanged. As an undead, a ravener uses its Charisma to determine bonus hit points instead of its Constitution. Saving Throws: As undead, a ravener uses its Charisma modifier on Fortitude saves (instead of Constitution). Defensive Abilities: A ravener gains channel resistance +4 and all of the immunities derived from undead traits. Its damage reduction changes from DR/magic to DR/ good. A ravener also gains the following ability. Soul Ward (Su): An intangible field of siphoned soul energy protects a ravener from destruction. This ward has a maximum number of hit points equal to twice the ravener\\'s Hit Dice, but starts at half this amount. Whenever a ravener would be reduced below 1 hit point, all damage in excess of that which would reduce it to 1 hit point is instead dealt to its soul ward. If this damage reduces the soul ward to fewer than 0 hit points, the ravener is destroyed. Attacks: A ravener retains all of the natural attacks of the base creature, but each of these attacks threatens a critical hit on a 19 or 20. Feats like Improved Critical can increase this range further. If the ravener scores a critical hit with a natural weapon, the target gains 1 negative level. The DC to remove this negative level is equal to 10 +1/2 the ravener\\'s Hit Dice +the ravener\\'s Charisma modifier. Whenever a creature gains a negative level in this way, the ravener adds 5 points to its soul ward. Special Attacks: A ravener retains all of the special attacks of the base creature and gains the following special attacks as described below. All save DCs are equal to 10 +1/2 the ravener\\'s HD +the ravener\\'s Charisma modifier. Breath Weapon (Su): A ravener keeps the breath weapon of the base creature-the save DC for this breath weapon is now Charisma-based. In addition, a ravener\\'s breath weapon bestows 2 negative levels on all creatures in the area. A successful Ref lex save halves the damage and reduces the energy drain to 1 negative level. The save DC to remove these negative levels is equal to the ravener\\'s breath weapon DC. The ravener adds 1 hit point to its soul ward ability for each negative level bestowed in this way. Cowering Fear (Su): Any creature shaken by the ravener\\'s frightful presence is cowering instead of shaken for the first round of the effect, and shaken for the rest of the duration. Any creature that is frightened by its frightful presence is instead cowering for the duration. Soul Consumption (Su): When a living creature within 30 feet of a ravener dies, that creature\\'s soul is torn from its body and pulled into the ravener\\'s maw if the dying creature fails a Will save (DC equals the save DC of the ravener\\'s breath weapon). This adds a number of hit points to the ravener\\'s soul ward equal to the dead creature\\'s Hit Dice. Creatures that have their souls consumed in this way can only be brought back to life through miracle, true resurrection, or wish. Soul Magic (Sp): A ravener retains the base creature\\'s spellcasting capability, adding three levels to the base creature\\'s caster level. This increases the number of spells known by the ravener, but the ravener loses all spell slots. Instead, whenever the ravener wishes to cast any one of its spells known, it consumes a number of hit points from its soul ward equal to the spell slot level necessary to cast the spell (including increased levels for metamagic feats and so on). If the soul ward has insufficient hit points, the ravener cannot cast that spell. Casting a spell that reduces its soul ward to exactly 0 hit points does not harm the ravener (though most are not comfortable without this buffer of soul-energy and try to replenish it quickly). Abilities: Str +4, Int +4, Wis +4, Cha +6. Being undead, a ravener has no Constitution score. Skills: A ravener has a +8 racial bonus on Intimidate, Perception, and Stealth checks. The ravener\\'s class skills are otherwise the same as those of the base creature.'},\n",

They hunt fish, giant crabs, dolphins, and even land-dwelling creatures that come within a hundred paces of the water. In populated areas, reefclaws prey on beachcombers, divers, and fishermen, sometimes abandoning their usual solitary nature and coordinating attacks with other reefclaws. The creatures must be wary, however, because in some regions, these abominations find their way to the dinner plate. Brave fishermen troll bays and coastlines infested with reefclaws, baiting the creatures with fresh meat and then harvesting their powerful claws with axes. Reefclaws cannot speak, but the creatures understand the languages used by humanoids near their hunting grounds. They use this knowledge in order to avoid fishermen and coordinate attacks. Reefclaws keep no treasure, instead savoring the taste of flesh and crunch of bone and shell as much as a miser covets his gold. A typical reefclaw reaches approximately 3-1/2 feet long at adulthood and weighs 70 pounds. Females gather to breed once every 2 to 3 years, engaging in a predatory hunt for a male and leaving him shredded to pieces.'},\n",

       "   'description': \"Stealthy and unpredictable, the sandman is a terror to all travelers in the desert, whether they be traders, messengers, or adventurers. When at rest, sandmen resemble ordinary piles of sand, blending in perfectly with barren surroundings or ancient tombs. They rely on their soporific powers in most situations, putting their enemies to sleep and killing their unconscious opponents or dragging them back to their summoner. Although they themselves are elementals, sandmen don't typically associate with other elementals, seeing their unquestioning obedience as weak. Sandmen pride themselves as free thinkers, and when given a task by a summoner, often interpret the task as they see fit. Because of their arrogance, usually only the most confident or most desperate mages bother with sandmen. It is not uncommon for sandmen to voluntarily stay on the Material Plane, fiendishly playing with its inhabitants as they wreak silent havoc. A sandman takes the form of a rough humanoid about 6 feet tall. Its shape is never quite certain, and its animate muscles constantly shift and flex as it pummels its targets. Sandmen can manipulate their bodies in many ways, but prefer to keep their legs and feet in the form of dusty clouds of sand, so as to easily maneuver about in their preferred environments. Some of these creatures pride themselves on their ability to control their shapes. Just as a mortal artist might sculpt incredible works of art from stone with a chisel, so do these artist sandmen sculpt their own bodies into works of art. Some enjoy using this ability to reshape their appearance to mimic that of their conjurer or their enemies, allowing them an additional level of theatrics by either assuming a beautiful form or by allowing their form to melt away in a hideous manner. Given the combination of their quick imaginations and their natural penchant for cruelty, most sandmen tend to opt for the latter method of tormenting their foes.\"},\n",

Scarecrows are usually created as guardians to warn away trespassers. Each scarecrow is unique, but most stand 5 to 6 feet tall and are made of wood, cloth, and rope. Their stuffing of dried grass or straw makes them vulnerable to fire. A scarecrow cannot speak, and the only sound it makes is the creaking of its wooden frame and the rustling of its straw stuffing when it moves. In combat, a scarecrow uses its fascinating gaze, then chooses the largest foe to pummel with its slams. Although unintelligent, the scarecrow does not ignore other enemies, using its fear touch to cow them until the scarecrow kills its first target. A scarecrow usually does not pursue fleeing foes unless specifically commanded to do so by its creator. Construction Scarecrows are constructed of a variety of materials, but usually include a frame of wood bound by rope or twine, covered in cloth or ragged garments, then stuffed with grass or straw. Some have simple heads made from bags stuffed with straw, with two holes cut for eyes, while others have more elaborate pumpkin or gourd heads carved with grotesque faces. Once the basic body has been constructed, unguents and special powders worth 500 gp are also required.

In the cold heart of the Negative Energy Plane, the un-substance of that realm coalesces into snowf lake-like crystals, and it is from these strange formations that sceaduinars arise, breaking free from their jagged \"eggs\" fully grown. They hate the living and the undead with equal passion, perhaps out of jealousy for those who have a spark of life (even if that spark is provided by a corruption of life in the form of undeath), though they usually ignore creatures from the Outer Sphere. They believe their positive energy counterparts, the jyoti, long ago stole their ability to create, breaking the parallel between the two energy planes and forcing these void-dwellers into an unwanted role of pure destruction. In a way, their hatred parallels that of another native of the Negative Energy Plane-the nightshade. Yet despite their similar goals, the sceaduinars see nightshades as just another corruption of life worthy of destruction-even though very few sceaduinars are powerful enough to directly oppose one of these deadly undead. Sceaduinars are quite intelligent, yet they have no real society to speak of. When they gather together, it is always to form a larger band to strike against a particularly dangerous foe.'},\n",

Whatever the case, scyllas are fortunately quite rare, enough so that many consider them nothing more than tall tales told by sailors deep in their cups. Scyllas dwell along major shipping lanes, often near coastlines, where they use their spell-like abilities to lure entire ships to their doom. The hideous monsters are intelligent creatures, though half-mad with hunger and self-loathing.

Their legends speak of how humanity rose to power only through the theft of serpent magic, a legend that may form the basis of the hatred toward humanity most serpentfolk harbor. They view themselves as the undisputed masters of magic, be it arcane or divine. Yet despite this, the majority of serpentfolk today are degenerates who have devolved to the point of primeval savagery and have lost much of their magical legacy-more civilized serpentfolk generally regard these degenerates with shame and disdain. Serpentfolk are 6 feet tall and weigh 120 pounds. Degenerates are only 5 feet tall but weigh 200 pounds. All serpentfolk are quite long-lived, and generally live to the age of 500. Advanced Serpentfolk When a serpentfolk gains class levels, several of its abilities increase as well, as detailed below. • Spell Resistance equals total Hit Dice +10. • Poison bite save DC equals 10 +Con modifier +1/2 total Hit Dice. • When it is 4th level in any class combination, it gains two spell-like abilities usable once per day each: dominate person and major image. When it reaches 9th level in any combination, it gains two more usable once per day each: mass suggestion and teleport. • A serpentfolk's racial ability score modifiers are as follows: Str -2, Dex +10, Con +6, Int +8, Wis +4, Cha +6. Degenerate Serpentfolk Degenerate serpentfolk possess the same statistics as normal serpentfolk, save for the following adjustments. • They have no spell-like abilities. • They lose the +4 racial bonus on Use Magic Device checks, but gain a +4 racial bonus on Perception checks. • Their natural armor bonus increases from +3 to +7. • They have the following ability score modifiers: Str +10, Dex +2, Con +8, Int -6 (minimum 3), Wis +2, Cha -4. A typical degenerate serpentfolk's ability scores are Str 20, Dex 13, Con 19, Int 4, Wis 13, Cha 6.\"},\n",

They are intelligent creatures and cannot be trained as mounts-a would-be shantak rider must use diplomacy or magic to secure a shantak's cooperation as a mount, and even then, shantaks have a tendency to deliberately strand riders in dangerous areas. Many shantaks have a strange and irrational fear of certain creatures, such as the faceless nightgaunts said to dwell in certain remote mountains, or specific types of harpies or gargoyles in more civilized regions. A shantak avoids confrontations with these types of creatures if possible. A shantak's ability to travel the gulfs of space ensures that these scaly, bird-like creatures can be found on numerous worlds. Yet despite this unique ability, shantaks are generally quite reluctant to seek out new worlds unless faced with no other option, for a shantak knows well that an attempt to fly to an unknown world could easily result in being lost forever in the gulfs of space.\"},\n",

Their unabashed cowardice is perhaps their most widely known trait, but skulks don't see themselves as particularly craven. Instead, they view their dishonorable behaviors as the most expedient method of survival. They hate most other humanoids, viewing them as lazy and foolish, and think nothing of sneaking into a home, killing all the residents, and burglarizing what they can carry off without getting caught. Skulks travel in small groups, rarely forming tribes of more than 16, for in larger groups bickering quickly leads to violent infighting. Murder between skulks is not uncommon, but they understand safety in numbers, and most frown upon treason within a group that is already relatively small, punishing traitors with a quick death. When possible, they set up camps in discreet spots near other settlements, commonly inhabiting sewers, caves, or forests-though their unsavory, murderous tactics often force them to relocate before local law enforcement, quickly alerted to their presence once the remains of a family of victims are discovered, finds them. Skulks are roughly the same size as a human, averaging 6 feet tall, though they are significantly more gangly and nimble, and commonly weigh only 140 pounds. Skinny arms and legs help them sneak around obstacles and squeeze into narrow spaces. Skulks can live up to 50 years, though most die from violence long before that. Although skulks have racial Hit Dice, they generally advance in power by taking class levels. Rogue is a favorite choice among skulks, for their natural abilities at stealth and sneak attacks fit well with this choice, but they also excel in the roles of clerics, fighters and rangers who specialize in ranged weapons, and rarely as wizards (particularly illusionists).\"},\n",

       "   'description': \"Slime molds are revolting oozes that wallow in rot and decay. A perfect example of symbiosis, each slime mold is covered in a thick garden of fungi, mildew, and toadstools, which helps it blend in with the surroundings. As ambush hunters, they can lie silently in wait for days at a time, surging into frenzied movement as soon as prey comes within reach. Most commonly encountered in deep forests, variations have adapted to life in caverns and sewers as well. They lack any ability to digest food, and rely entirely on their symbiotic fungal gardens to break down any organic matter they find into easily absorbed compost and decay. The molds and mushrooms that coat the ooze in turn receive ample food supplies, and over countless generations, many have developed into deadly variations of the forest or cave fungi from which they evolved. This fungal breakdown is in many ways akin to a disease-known as fungal rot, it can kill if allowed to progress for long. Those who succumb to fungal rot become tired and listless. Eventually, paralysis sets in and the victim's flesh begins to blacken and decay, running from the body in liquid streams that the slime mold can easily absorb. In a somewhat nauseating turnabout, certain creatures find the unusual fungus that grows upon a slime mold to be quite tasty, and these creatures actively hunt slime molds to devour their gardens-although they take care to avoid actual contact with the mold itself unless they happen to be immune to disease. Slime molds are ovoid in shape, growing up to 12 feet in length and weighing more than 600 pounds. Their substance is normally a sickly greenish-brown, with the coloration varying depending on their environment and how recently they've fed. They instinctually keep their coating of fungus and other vegetable detritus exposed above them, granting the slime mold a distinctive, undulating gait rather than the fluid movement of most oozes. To reproduce, slime molds split off small patches of their bodies whenever they encounter thick beds of fungi or mold. Over several months, these tiny blobs acclimate to the rot and absorb each another, until a single slime mold (with the young creature simple template) sprouts its own garden and begins hunting live prey.\"},\n",

       "   'description': \"An alien inhabitant of the dark underworld, the slithering tracker is a glistening creature of transparent ooze, typically about 3 inches thick and at least 3 feet in diameter. When still, it looks like a wet patch of stone or a patch of condensation on a wall. Comparatively slow moving, the slithering tracker relies on its transparency and knack for ambushing to surprise prey. Once a slithering tracker has paralyzed a living creature, it flows over an exposed patch of flesh, grabbing on and draining blood from the victim. A slithering tracker can drain a human-sized creature of its blood with shocking swiftness, leaving only a desiccated carcass behind. A slithering tracker can go some time between meals, but never turns down easy prey. The larger a slithering tracker grows, the more voracious its appetite becomes, until, after a particularly large feeding, the creature splits into two smaller slithering trackers that eventually go their separate ways in search of feeding territory. Slithering trackers are not harmed by bright light, but still prefer to avoid areas of intense illumination or natural sunlight, and so only venture aboveground at night. They prefer the cool, damp environment of their native caves and tunnels. Although intelligent and cunning, slithering trackers are entirely alien creatures. They do not possess any language of their own, although they can usually understand the dominant language of the region they dwell in-usually Undercommon. Some underworld inhabitants do manage to forge alliances with slithering trackers, or at least exist with them in symbiosis by providing the creatures with easy and regular prey, but as one can never truly know a slithering tracker's desires or motivations, such alliances are dangerous to rely upon.\"},\n",

Though the dwarves failed to create suitable livestock, the sticky frog-beasts are often befriended by other underground races. Slurks are carnivores and have a formidable bite, thanks to their massive tusks. Their true strength, however, lies in their foul-smelling and unnatural secretions. The mucus exuded from the slurk's back is incredibly sticky and quickly hardens into a powerful resin, a quality the creature turns to its advantage by squirting it at intruders and then waiting for it to harden before closing for the kill. At the same time, the liquid excreted by glands on a slurk's stomach is incredible slippery, allowing the slurk to keep from being immobilized by its own back slime and also making it extremely hard to grapple or maneuver without its consent. Combined with slurks' natural ability to climb walls and hang from ceilings with ease, these abilities make the foul-smelling creatures extremely desirable to kobolds, who domesticate and train the frog-beasts as powerful mounts and guardians.\"},\n",

       "   'description': \"These small, sentient dolls contain a fragment of another creature's soul. The binding process strips most of the individuality from the soul, making a new soulbound doll an almost blank slate. Despite this process, fragments of the original creature's personality remain. Soulbound dolls can serve as companions, surrogate children, servants, guards, and sentries, as desired by their creators. Creators of soulbound dolls typically take care to take soul fragments from people whose personality traits the crafters wish to see in their dolls. Construction A soulbound doll's body is made from wood, stone, or porcelain, with one exquisite item worth at least 300 gp to serve as the soul focus. Creation requires a soul fragment from a deceased creature that must die at some point during the creation of the doll-as a result, most soulbound dolls are created by evil spellcasters. Other spellcasters can create soulbound dolls, but if the donor soul is unwilling, they may have alignment repercussions. An unwilling soul can resist the procedure with a DC 20 Will save. Stripping a soul fragment from the dead does not prevent the rest of the soul from continuing on to the afterlife, nor does it prevent the body from later being resurrected or raised from the dead. SOULBOUND DOLL CL 7th; Price 4,300 gp Construction Requirements Craft Construct, false life, lesser geas, magic jar, minor creation, soul of a living creature who dies or is slain during the creation process; Skill Craft (sculptures); Cost 2,300 gp.\"},\n",

       "   'description': 'Sylphs are humans whose family trees include elemental beings of air, such as djinn. They tend to be pale and thin to the point of appearing delicate, though their skinny bodies are more resilient than they look. While many can pass unnoticed through crowds of humans, sylphs display their heritage in subtle ways, and those who study them carefully sometimes notice that breezes seem to follow a sylph wherever she goes, even inside rooms with no windows. When consumed by fits of anger or passion, these tendencies become more apparent, as winds surround the sylph and tousle her hair or knock small items from shelves. Many sylphs have complex markings on their pale flesh that resemble tiny swirling designs like blue and gray tattoos, and the most exotic of their kind have hair that twists and coils almost as if it were made of living mist. As people, sylphs tend to be shy and reclusive, blending into crowds or skillfully avoiding those they don\\'t desire to meet. Yet while they often prefer to manipulate situations and avoid conf lict themselves, most sylphs remain intensely curious about other people, and often go to great lengths to spy or eavesdrop on those who spark their interest (a hobby frequently referred to as \"listening to the wind\"). This combined love of subterfuge and ability to slip away from any compromising situation makes sylphs perfectly suited to lives as rogues, thieves, and spies, and beneath the average sylph\\'s veneer of shy waifishness lies a mind that\\'s capable and calculating, constantly sizing up the competition and analyzing the most effective exits from any given room. SYLPH CHARACTERS Sylphs are defined by class levels-they do not possess racial Hit Dice. Sylphs have the following racial traits. +2 Dexterity, +2 Intelligence, -2 Constitution: Sylphs are quick and insightful, but slight and delicate. Darkvision: Sylphs can see in the dark up to 60 feet. Sylph Magic: Feather fall 1/day (caster level equals the sylph\\'s Hit Dice). Energy Resistance: Sylphs have electricity resistance 5. Air Affinity: See above. Languages: Sylphs begin play speaking Common and Auran. Sylphs with high Intelligence scores can choose any of the following bonus languages: Aquan, Dwarven, Elven, Gnome, Half ling, Ignan, and Terran.'},\n",

Tales and myths speak of arcane manipulation from other planes, while others speak of a tendriculos as being the manifestation of an angered spirit of nature. A voracious carnivore, the tendriculos is an active hunter when it needs to be but it prefers to rely on ambush tactics, choosing welltraveled areas in the forest where it can lie in wait in the undergrowth. The creature is quick to swallow any prey it happens to catch in its vines, relying upon the acidfilled reservoir in its trunk to finish off prey that may still have a bit of fight left in it. This acid not only consumes organic material with shocking ease, but also contains a powerful paralytic enzyme that further reduces a creature\\'s chance of escape once it\\'s been gulped down by the plant. Although incapable of speech itself, the tendriculos generally understands a handful of words in a single language (usually Sylvan). While they tend to see all smaller creatures as nothing more than food, tales exist of certain creatures, particularly fey or druids, having secured a sort of alliance with local tendriculoses. In such cases, the tendriculos is more than willing to serve its ally as a guardian, so long as the ally is diligent at providing the plant with a regular supply of food. The fact that a tendriculos displays a curious mix of plant, fungal, and even animal traits (in the form of its almost fleshy, toothed maw) has long intrigued sages. That the creature is a plant is firmly established, yet it lays egg-like spheres when the need to reproduce strikes. These \"eggs\" are in fact massive, puff ball-like fungi filled with spores-when jostled, the cloud of spores that is released can carry for miles, ensuring that a single tendriculos can seed a huge territory. A tendriculos is 20 feet tall and weighs 3,500 pounds.'},\n",

The tenebrous worm is the larval stage of the gloomwing (see page 133)-but in a strange reversal, these younger creatures are more dangerous than the adults they grow into. A native of the Plane of Shadow, a tenebrous worm hatches from the body of an unfortunate creature that has been implanted with an egg by a gloomwing. The tenebrous worm is fully grown upon hatching, and immediately begins to scour its environs for flesh to consume. Although the tenebrous worm tends to be relatively palecolored, its internal organs seethe and roil with shadowy energies and dark fluids. As the creature feeds, these shadowy innards begin to grow out of its body, forming strange bristle-like filaments of semisolid shadowstuff not only capable of piercing the flesh of those who would attack the worm, but also possessing a deadly paralytic poison. Additional shadowy fluids constantly seep from the worm's mandibles-when it bites prey, these fluids melt flesh into shadows that the creature can then consume. When a tenebrous worm feeds on enough of this shadowy flesh, the creature seeks out a secluded, shady area (typically just within a cave entrance or in a ruined building) and spins a shadowy cocoon around itself. A tenebrous worm's cocoon exudes the effects of a darkness spell (CL 8th), muting the surrounding light. After a period of several days, the cocoon tears open and a fully grown gloomwing emerges, ready to seek a host for its eggs.\"},\n",

       "   'description': 'Tentamorts are eerie ambush predators, preferring to let prey come to them rather than seeking food out, and relying on their excellent senses to warn them of approaching meals. A tentamort possesses several tentacles, most of which are used for locomotion but two of which have evolved for singular purposes in securing food. One of these longer tentacles is covered with tiny, sticky nodules and is capable of constricting prey, while the other ends in a long, thin stinger. The tentamort\\'s method of attack is to grab its prey with its constricting tentacle and sting the grappled target with the other. Tentamort poison is particularly horrific, as it swiftly liquefies the creature\\'s internal organs into a rancid slurry the monster can then drink with the same stinger, siphoning out the fluid with foul sucking sounds. Larger creatures often require multiple stings (and multiple failed saving throws against the venom) before they can be fully absorbed by a tentamort. Tentamorts are almost mindless, possessing just enough intellect to make crude animal judgments about peril and food. Once a tentamort has grabbed prey, it tends to focus entirely on that creature, ignoring attacks upon it from other sources as long as its current victim remains a source of nutrition. After a tentamort finishes consuming a creature, all that typically remains are the bones and skin. A well-fed tentamort uses the hollow corpse of its meal as a sort of incubator for its eggs, injecting the body with a caviar-like mass of black eggs that mature in the rotting carcass for several weeks until a dozen or so hand-sized tentamorts hatch and crawl out of their host\\'s orifices. Depending upon the availability of other prey, anywhere from one to six of these may survive, feeding on rats and Tiny vermin, until they eventually grow to adulthood. Tentamort young look like dark blue starfish with a single red eye in the center-they do not possess their longer, specialized tentacles until they mature. A young tentamort often attaches itself to a larger predator, clinging to it much the same way a remora clings to a shark, dropping off to feed innocuously on its host\\'s kills while the creature sleeps. Some tentamorts grow much larger than their human-sized kin. Known as greater tentamorts, these ogre-sized creatures have at least 10 Hit Dice and are Large sized. Their two specialized tentacles grow to 20 feet long, providing the creature with greater reach than a Large monster normally possesses. Greater tentamorts are never found in groups, for these creatures can only achieve such monstrous size through cannibalism, as if there were some key nutrient in another tentamort\\'s body that allows them to exceed their typical physical limitations. Some of these creatures have mutations giving them two tentacles and two stingers. Yet the most disturbing quality possessed by these monsters is their unexpected intellect-greater tentamorts are often as intelligent as humans, or more so. They cannot speak, but possess an eerie form of telepathy that works only upon creatures they are in physical contact with-a feature they often use to \"chat\" with their food as they eat.'},\n",

Thoqquas are native to the vast ash deserts and lava fields where the Plane of Fire abuts the Plane of Earth. There they consume ore and minerals, which their furnace-like bodies then smelt into armor plates that grant the creatures their natural armor-as outsiders, these creatures have no need to eat to survive, but a \"starving\" thoqqua generally has a lower natural armor bonus than a healthy one. A thoqqua\\'s frontmost body segment tapers into a straight, horn-like beak that glows with a blistering heat. Steam and smoke constantly hiss from its joints, and from a distance a thoqqua can be mistaken for a strange metallic construct. Adult thoqquas are 5 feet long and weigh 200 pounds. Their fiery tempers make thoqquas dangerous to approach-they attack without thinking when startled or frustrated. If a thoqqua does not immediately chase away humanoids within its territory, then it gradually comes to view that settlement as property, and even guards it. Mephits seem to understand the thoqqua thought process, and occasionally broker deals with the simple-minded worms. The mephits say that the mountain-sized ancestors of modern thoqquas were servants of the elemental lords, and dug the first volcanoes in the young worlds of the Material Plane. These progenitor worms then retired to the worlds\\' cores, where their heat warms the planets even today. Thoqquas on the Material Plane do indeed congregate around volcanoes-though whether this is to protect a mineral-rich food site or a sacred place is unknown.'},\n",

As this war began, the Elysian titans turned against their kin and, by sacrificing some of their power to the gods, convinced the deities to banish their arrogant kin to the Abyss. Lone Elysian titans often wander the planes, seeking enlightenment or exploring ancient places of power. Others still have the crusading impulse of the ancient war and can be found manipulating events from behind the scenes, training aspiring heroes, counseling kings, marshaling armies to overthrow tyranny, and inspiring mortals to become legends. A titan does not age-unless slain by violence, a titan is immortal. One in every dozen Elysian titans is a prophet-a titan who manifests the goodwill of the gods and possesses the spellcasting power of a 20th-level cleric. These titans do not gain access to domains or any other cleric class abilities. They are CR 22 creatures. Elysian titans are 70 feet tall and weigh 20 tons.'},\n",

       "   'description': \"These aquatic outsiders resemble merfolk, except where a merman has a single fish tail, a triton has two scaly, finned legs. They are the watchers of the sea, often using dolphins or other aquatic creatures as mounts, and maintaining a vigil against the evil races below the waves. Originally hailing from the Plane of Water, long ago the triton race migrated to the oceans of the Material Plane, and they are now fully adapted to life there. Their split legs allow them to hobble about slowly on land, but they rarely do so, preferring their natural environment and the greater mobility their forms afford there. Tritons make their homes on the sea floor, growing coral reefs and sculpting stones into gentle arcs to create living spaces that are beautiful and naturallooking. Many of these sites lie near great thermal vents, providing not only heat but also rich minerals and nutrients for the fish and other creatures tritons eat. Tritons can breathe air or water, but prefer water. While their cities are designed for water-breathers, they usually feature one or two airtight buildings set aside to hold air for landwalking visitors. Triton settlements can be found anywhere from arctic to tropical waters, but most are in temperate locations. They generally avoid the deepest reaches of the ocean, for it is here that creatures like aboleths and krakens rule-creatures that the tritons have long waged war against. Tritons maintain relationships with other good undersea creatures, but mostly keep to themselves. They aid others in fights against their enemies (primarily krakens and aboleths, but also lesser evils like sahuagin or skum). They typically form strong squadrons of aquatic cavalry trained in coordinated attacks when they go to war. Tritons tend to distrust outsiders, and usually avoid land-dwellers. They sometimes provide aid to airbreathers, even though they often see them as trespassers under the sea; when they do help landwalkers, their price for this is high. Nevertheless, when they witness a landwalker do battle against and vanquish a great evil such as an aboleth, they are quick to cast aside their prejudices and accept the great hero into their societies with open and welcoming arms. Tritons have silvery skin, hued in tones of aqua blue and kelp green. Older tritons often have barnacles, corals, and seashells crusting the back, chest, and shoulders, worn almost like jewelry as a mark of status among their kind. They have white, blue, or green hair. Tritons' eyes shine blue like sunlight upon a clear sea. A typical triton stands 6 feet in height and weighs 180 pounds. While most exceptional tritons advance by taking class levels (typically as druids, oracles, or rangers), a rare few tritons advance by increasing in size. These Large tritons are great heroes among their kind and have 8 racial Hit Dice or more.\"},\n",

They display the typical hunched posture of trolls, combined with long arms tipped with sharp claws and the distinctive troll underbite. Like normal trolls, ice trolls possess amazing regenerative powers that enable them to recover from almost any wound. Unlike most trolls, ice trolls often use weapons in battle, but in the heat of combat, they often cast aside weapons in favor of their rending claws. An ice troll stands about 10 feet tall and weighs up to 900 pounds. Because of their greater intellects, ice trolls sometimes work as mercenaries, and often serve as soldiers in monstrous armies. They frequently ally with frost giants, and may even be found among northern barbarian tribes, as long as they are well fed and well paid. Ice trolls enjoy the taste of human flesh, and those not working with humans frequently set traps near civilized areas to catch their favorite prey. They will also raid isolated settlements for food, often bringing captured humans back to their icy lairs, where the unfortunate victims are caged and fattened up before finally being devoured by the voracious trolls. In combat, ice trolls are more cautious than normal trolls. They do not normally rush headlong into battle, instead focusing on weaker foes or those bearing fire. They do not hesitate to attack opponents armed with fire, but work together to defeat such enemies before they can bring their dangerous weapons to bear. Ice troll society is more patriarchal than normal troll society, and while males may form gangs to hunt or raid, most ice trolls live in small family groups comprised of a male, a female, and their offspring.'},\n",

Because of the crystalline nature of their skin, however, rock trolls prove more susceptible to sonic damage than other trolls, but they are able to regenerate even wounds dealt by fire. Rock trolls are larger and stronger than normal trolls, typically standing 15 to 16 feet tall in height, and weighing upward of 1,200 pounds. Rock trolls are fond of humanoid flesh, but eat whatever food they can get their claws on. Most underground creatures go out of their way to avoid rock trolls, as the ravenous creatures will eat anything that passes through their territory, as long as it is at least marginally edible. Rock trolls also occasionally eat rocks and minerals, though such fare seems to do little to soothe their voracious hungers. Instead, these minerals supplement the trolls' diet, strengthening their skin, teeth, and claws. Deposits of certain crystals seem especially tasty to rock trolls, and a rock troll who finds such a collection will often gorge himself on the crystalline delicacies.\"},\n",

This connection with the Plane of Water is most noticeably manifested in their coloration, which tends to mimic that of lakes or oceans-all undines have limpid, blue eyes, and their skin and hair can range from pale blue-white to the deep blue or green of the sea. UNDINE CHARACTERS Undines are defined by class levels-they do not possess racial Hit Dice. Undines have the following racial traits. +2 Dexterity, +2 Wisdom, -2 Strength: Undines are both perceptive and agile, but tend to adapt rather than match force with force. Speed: Undines have a swim speed of 30 feet. Darkvision: Undines can see in the dark up to 60 feet. Spell-Like Abilities: Hydraulic push* 1/day. (Caster level equals the undine's total Hit Dice.) Energy Resistance: Undines have cold resistance 5. Water Affinity: See above. Languages: Undines begin play speaking Common and Aquan. Undines with high Intelligence scores can choose any of the following bonus languages: Auran, Dwarven, Elven, Gnome, Halfling, Ignan, and Terran. * This spell is detailed in the Pathfinder RPG Advanced Player's Guide.\"},\n",

Although somewhat intelligent, vampiric mists do not form societies. They sometimes form into small gangs, but even then they show little interest in working together. Much of a vampiric mist's time is spent seeking prey-a pursuit that the monster often shows great creativity in accomplishing. The creatures' propensity for taking on vague, skeletal forms of the creatures whose blood they drink only further adds to their mystique and fuels rumors that they have connections to the undead. Indeed, many vampiric mists enjoy using this common misconception to their advantage, causing foes to use foolish tactics-such as tricking spellcasters into using positive energy against them as if they were undead monsters.\"},\n",

When the plant senses the approach of suitable prey through its sensitive, shallowly buried root system, it rises up like an agitated snake and unfurls its brightly colored bloom, an act that releases a cloud of mind-numbing pollen. While stories speaking of the plant's ability to lure prey into its clutches by virtue of its swaying motion persist, this effect is in fact created by this invisible, odorless pollen cloud. Since viper vines gain nourishment through the consumption of creatures rather than through moisture and soil, they have developed rudimentary locomotion and are able to drag themselves along the ground with their tentacle-like root system. They even possess a form of rudimentary sentience, allowing them to not only discern differences in prey and make limited tactical decisions, but also to avoid creatures that are particularly large or dangerous looking. The area around the hunting grounds of these predators is often strewn with the remains of victims, and it is not unusual to find the rotting corpses of wild animals, illfated adventurers, and even giants in their immediate vicinity, along with a scattering of incidental treasure left behind by the plant's victims.\"},\n",

Water orms are craftier than sea serpents, and generally inclined toward curiosity rather than violence. Nevertheless, a water orm does not hesitate to attack any creature it views as a threat to itself or its lake. Water orms are extremely long-lived. Several different variants have been reported. With sightings rare and unverifiable, it is unclear whether these are variations within a single species, or several unrelated creatures. Some are described as long-necked aquatic reptiles, some as fresh-water sea serpents, others as bizarrely elongated seals or whales, and still others as impossibly large sea horses.

Tribal humanoids sometimes worship wendigos as gods, bringing them live sacrifices or attempting to appease the creatures by engaging in ritual cannibalism. They mark a wendigo's territory with fetishes and dress in the furs and hides of whatever animal it most closely resembles. Wendigos take little interest in the practices of their worshipers, and view them only as an ample supply of victims.\"},\n",

These ghostly creatures appear much as they did in life, although the grotesque undead energy that births them makes them appear young and attractive and wreathes their insubstantial bodies in a powerful aura of sickly green flame, a ghostly fire referred to as \"witchflame\" in local legends. Strings of will-o\\'-wisps are often found in the immediate vicinity of witchfires and are typically led by the undead, leading scholars to speculate that the creatures feed off of a witchfire\\'s flames and fury. WITCHFIRE COVENS Witchfires occasionally join or subjugate existing hag covens (see page 167 of the Pathfinder RPG Bestiary). A hag coven that includes a witchfire gains the following additional coven spell-like abilities: 3/day-blight, create undead, fire storm (DC 21), nightmare (DC 18), waves of exhaustion (DC 20). All abilities function at CL 9th, and save DCs are based on a Charisma score of 16. The use of these abilities functions identically to other coven abilities. Such covens must have at least one living hag, as covens of three witchfires gain no coven-related abilities.'},\n",

The flesh of the decaying body fats and instructs the very worms that gnaw, and these graveworms quicken not only on corruption but upon the spellcaster\\'s memories and magical power. The spellcaster\\'s very soul is consumed in this vile process, only to be split apart to inhabit each of the individual chewing worms in so many fragments. The result is a hideous hive mind of slithering life known as a worm that walks-a mass of worms that clings to the vague shape of the body that granted it this new existence, and can wield the powers and magic the spellcaster had in life. A worm that walks retains memories of its life as a spellcaster before its death, but is not undead-it is a hideous new form of undulant life. Creating a Worm That Walks \"Worm that walks\" is a template that can be added to any evil spellcasting creature. A worm that walks retains all the base creature\\'s statistics and abilities except as noted here. CR: Same as the base creature +2. Alignment: Any evil. Type: The base creature\\'s type changes to vermin. It gains the augmented subtype. Do not recalculate BAB, saves, or skill ranks. Worms that walk are intelligent and do not possess the standard mindless trait of most vermin. Note that while a worm that walks has the ability to discorperate into a swarm, and while its body is made up of countless wriggling worms, it does not itself gain the swarm subtype. Size: Although the worms that make up the worm that walks\\'s body are Fine creatures, the worm that walks is treated as a creature the same size as the base creature. Senses: As the base creature, plus darkvision 60 feet and blindsight 30 feet. AC: The worm that walks loses any natural armor bonus the base creature may have had, but gains an insight bonus to its AC equal to its Wisdom bonus (minimum of +2). Hit Dice: Change the base creature\\'s racial HD to d8s. All HD derived from class levels remain unchanged. Defensive Abilities: A worm that walks retains all of the base creature\\'s defensive abilities and special qualities. It also gains the following additional defensive abilities. Worm that Walks Traits: A worm that walks has no discernible anatomy, and is not subject to critical hits or flanking. Reducing a worm that walks to 0 hit points causes it to discorporate (see below)-a worm that walks at 0 hit points is staggered, and one at negative hit points is dying. Worms that walk are immune to any physical spell or effect that targets a specific number of creatures (including single-target spells such as disintegrate), with the exception of such spells and effects generated by the worm that walks itself, which treat the worm that walks as one single creature if it so chooses. Mind-affecting effects that target single creatures function normally against a worm that walks, since the creature\\'s individual components share a hive mind. A worm that walks takes half again as much damage (+50%) from damaging area effects, such as fireball and splash weapons. Worms that walk are susceptible to high winds-treat a worm that walks as a Fine creature for the purposes of determining wind effects. Damage Reduction: A worm that walks loses any damage reduction possessed by the base creature and gains damage reduction 15/-. Fast Healing: A worm that walks gains fast healing equal to its CR. Immunities: Worms that walk are immune to disease, paralysis, poison, and sleep effects. Melee Attacks: A worm that walks loses any natural attacks the base creature had, but gains a slam attack that deals damage based on its size (see Table 3-1: Natural Attacks by Size, on page 299). This slam has the grab ability and affects creatures up to one size larger than the worm that walks. A worm that walks retains any weapon proficiencies the base creature had. Special Attacks: A worm that walks retains all of the base creature\\'s special attacks. It also gains the following additional special attacks. Discorporate (Su) A worm that walks can collapse into a shapeless swarm of worms as a free action. All held, worn, and carried items fall and its Strength score drops to 1. The worm that walks functions as a true swarm while discorporated, with a reach of 0 feet (its space remains unchanged). While discorporated, the worm that walks loses all of its defensive abilities and gains all of the standard swarm traits. It loses its slam attacks and all special abilities and special attacks, but can make a swarm attack that deals damage equal to its engulf attack. A worm that walks can reform into its true form (including equipping all gear in reach) as a fullround action as long as it has at least 1 hit point. Squirming Embrace (Ex) If a worm that walks grapples a foe, as a swift action, it can cause a swarm of worms to squirm over the grappled creature. These worms deal automatic swarm damage with no attack roll needed (see the table below). If a creature takes damage from the swarm, it is also subject to the swarm\\'s distraction ability, and must make a Fortitude save or be nauseated for 1 round. The save DC equals 10 +1/2 the worm that walks\\'s HD +its Con modifier). A worm that walks can only have one embraced target at a time, but it does not have to continue grappling in order to maintain the embrace. If the worm that walks moves more than 5 feet from the swarm or dismisses the swarm (a free action), the swarm dies. Any area attack that damages the swarm or any severe or stronger wind effect that affects the swarm\\'s target kills it. Tenacious (Ex) A worm that walks gains a +8 racial bonus on CMB checks made to grapple and a +4 racial bonus to its CMD. Abilities: Dex +4, Con +4. Skills: Worms that walk gain a +8 racial bonus on Perception, Sense Motive, and Stealth checks. Feats: Worms that walk gain Diehard as a bonus feat. Engulf Damage HD Engulf Damage 1-5 1d6 +1.5 Str bonus 6-10 2d6 +1.5 Str bonus 11-15 3d6 +1.5 Str bonus 16-20 4d6 +1.5 Str bonus 21 or more 5d6 +1.5 Str bonus'},\n",

The strange, face-like patterns that grow on the petals are disturbing but seem to have no real function. Hermits or other reclusive types have been known to surround their territory with xtabays, warding off pesky creatures and adventurers alike. Instances of xtabays of larger-than-usual size have also been reported. These massive plants possess tendrils as thick as tree limbs and flowers that can fell even the hardiest of warriors with their overwhelming perfume. Underground, xtabays thrive in the wet, dark environment, covering the walls and floors of entire caverns and anesthetizing whole dens of subterranean creatures. Nomadic plants, xtabays traverse large expanses of land until they sense nearby life, at which point they lie dormant and take on the guise of harmless flowers while releasing their deceptive aroma. Once a creature is subdued, the beast-like plant wastes no time in devouring it, disregarding creatures unaffected by its aroma. Because of their carnivorous nature, xtabays only rarely run short on nutrients, consuming the entirety of a victim's body over the course of several days following the initial process of draining its blood. Xtabays are able to devour creatures thanks to their lengthy roots, which produce a corrosive acid that breaks down and absorbs flesh and bone.\"},\n",

While its powerful jaws and claws are equally capable of taking down opponents, the yrthak generally prefers to wheel through the sky on its membranous wings, firing bolt after bolt of sound into its prey, and exulting in the thrill of the hunt. An adult yrthak is 20 feet long and weighs 1,500 pounds. Yrthaks spend most of their time aloft-a yrthak hunt often lasts several days, with the yrthak skimming roughly 100 feet over the ground in its wide-ranging search for live prey, only resorting to grazing on carrion in direst need. While they have near-human intelligence, yrthaks generally do not seem interested in forming societies of their own-although the sight of a clutch of yrthaks tormenting a captured morsel might seem to indicate otherwise.'},\n",

       "   'description': 'The Arcanotheign is a mysterious creature serving the mad god Nethys. Because her creator sends her to Golarion on missions to heal, destroy, or spy, she is familiar with creatures of the mortal world, yet still very much an outsider, and she is fascinated by the intricacies of mortal interactions and history. In her natural, incorporeal form, she is a storm of magic, immediately recognizable as a creature of the arcane and divine. Ever curious, she often asks personal, direct questions of those she is sent to interact with, even as she repairs their wounds or tears their souls from their bodies. Sometimes she is told to assume a physical form, and lives among humanoids as a mysterious oracle for days or weeks, observing those near her and giving cryptic answers to those who dare approach her. She stands just over 7 feet tall, and has a habit of floating a few inches above the ground instead of walking. Ecology The Arcanotheign understands she is foreign to mortal life and mortal needs. She enjoys experiencing new aromas and tastes; someone wishing to get on her good side should bring her strongly scented flowers, a tasty meal, or some other physical object that may be new to her experience, even if humans would think it stinks or is inedible. She is interested in animals, and if she spends much time in the same place, she may \"adopt\" those living near her, especially orphaned ones. Some in the church suspect that her attention can cause mutations in these creatures, either directly or in its offspring, creating strange hybrids or magical creatures. The Arcanotheign has a lesser interest in children, though if a lost child finds its way to her, she is more likely to protect it or return it home than to ignore or harm it. Some of these children develop sorcerous power, typically with the arcane or destined bloodline. Habitat & Society As a supernatural creature created in a moment of lucidity by an insane, omniscient god, the Arcanotheign is often left to her own devices when her master does not need her, and wanders Golarion and the planes searching for new sensations and meaning to her existence and that of the multiverse. She is a lonely creature and welcomes those who would speak to her as part of a normal conversation rather than an attempt to get information from her. Her affection for animals is related to this; they are simple creatures who make no demands of her, and her habit of animating giant bears, lions, and other animals out of earth, stone, or wood represents her respect for animals she has known in the past ages.'},\n",

       "   'description': 'Sometimes called elder serpents, inkanyambas are enormous, malevolent snake-like creatures that dwell in tropical lakes and deep jungle rivers. Measuring over 60 feet long and weighing nearly 3,000 pounds, an inkanyamba resembles a dense snake with a vaguely crocodilian head, filled with multiple sets of fangs of varying lengths. Its long body is covered in multicolored scales that range from emerald green to golden and even vermilion. Males have larger hoods than females, who also have small, pointed frills running the length of their bodies. Inkanyambas live for centuries; their maximum possible lifespan is unknown. Ecology Larger than the biggest constrictors and possessing more venom than a hundred asps, the inkanyamba combines the deadliest and most efficient predatory traits of serpentkind with a diabolical intelligence. Able to attack from the water or the land, an inkanyamba is always the top predator in its region, capable of devouring prey as large and formidable as rhinos, dire crocodiles, and even elephants. Sages once thought that the inkanyamba\\'s elongated head was evidence of the creature being crossed with some other species, suggesting magic in the inkanyamba\\'s origin. In reality, the inkanyamba\\'s long skull is necessary to house the numerous glands storing the creature\\'s venom. Once thought to be a shifting, mutating poison, the inkanyamba actually carries several different toxins in its body, each type linked to a different set of fangs within the creature\\'s mouth. Making this ability even more potent, all inkanyambas have a latticework of small sensory organs inside their mouths and throughout their bodies in the small spaces between scales. When an inkanyamba makes physical contact with a living creature, these sensory organs detail the target\\'s physiology in a manner that allows the inkanyamba to know which of its many types of venom would be deadliest. Additionally, special ducts on the inside of the inkanyamba\\'s frontmost fangs allow the creature to spray gouts of venom up to great distances. Although an inkanyamba can only spit a single life-sapping venom, this spray needs only to make contact with a target to take effect and can blind victims caught in its blast. Even without their fabled variety of poisons, inkanyambas are capable predators. When an inkanyamba unfurls its massive hood and sways back and forth, a scintillating pattern of multi-hued scales on the inside of the creature\\'s neck can cause a hypnotic state in those that observe it. Inkanyambas often use this ability to approach targets on land or when confronted with multiple enemies. Once a target has been bitten, an inkanyamba can throw the rest of its body forward like a coiled rope, biting and then wrapping the victim in the creature\\'s crushing body. Inkanyambas dwell near large lakes and deep rivers. Such locations not only allow them to attack from the cover of water, but inkanyambas also lair in underwater caves where pockets of air have become trapped. Such nests are inaccessible to most intruders and allow the great serpents to slumber safely after gorging themselves. Habitat & Society Inkanyambas are solitary creatures except for the brief couplings that occur during mating. They favor areas that are populated by both animal life and human settlements. Pathfinders chronicling the history of the Mwangi Expanse have recounted instances of human and lizardfolk tribes alike revering inkanyambas as gods. In such cases, the monsters use their ability to control the weather and call up storms to create false portents that instill awe in the local inhabitants, extorting offerings and even living sacrifices from their terrified \"subjects.\" Cruel, malicious, and accustomed to being worshiped, inkanyambas are likely to attack anything they perceive as a threat. When facing well-prepared or powerful opponents, inkanyambas retreat deep beneath the closest body of water to exert their control over weather, using high winds to ground airborne opponents and thunderstorms to bolster their ability to summon lightning. If threatened, inkanyambas prefer escape to surrender, but some have been known to parlay with powerful groups of adventurers, usually to help the serpent acquire an item that it cannot gain for itself. Such offers, however, are never genuine, as all inkanyambas seek only their own selfish ends. In the depths of the Mwangi Expanse, the Zenj have a saying: \"Speaking to an inkanyamba only gives it time to encircle you.\"'},\n",

       "   'description': \"Umdhlebis are massive, intelligent, and carnivorous plants that take root in jungles. Their outer shell is brown and resembles the thick bark of a dead tree, while concealing the softer layer of green cellulose beneath. When they flower, umdhlebis grow broad, fragile-looking crimson leaves with sharp, grasping edges. Umdhlebis draw their prey close with mind-affecting suggestions, enticing would-be victims to rest at the plant's base, and then strike with their vine-like tendrils, each as thick as a man's forearm. Umdhlebis grow to almost 20 feet in height, but can be shorter or taller depending on the surrounding vegetation. An umdhlebi's trunk ranges from 3 to 5 feet in diameter, and the plant as a whole weighs over 10,000 pounds. Umdhlebis can live for up to 50 years. Ecology Legends say that the first umdhlebi was created when an assassin vine crawled into the hollow corpse of a slain, jungle-dwelling treant. The creatures fused together, returning the treant to life, but instilling in it a devastating hunger. Regardless of its true origins, the umdhlebi is known and feared throughout the jungles of the world. Resembling a tree with a hard outer coating, the umdhlebi is actually an intelligent and mobile plant, capable of uprooting itself to find food or escape danger. Although ambulatory, the umdhlebi is too slow to truly hunt and has evolved several methods to attract prey. An umdhlebi uses its large vines and brightly colored leaves to draw in animals and other creatures of lesser intelligence. Once in range, the umdhlebi lashes out with its strong, vine-like tendrils, enveloping and crushing its prey with bone-shattering force. Umdhlebis, however, prefer to feed on humanoids and can compel even the most strongminded individuals to approach their waiting snares. When sensing a nearby humanoid, an umdhlebi vibrates rows of fine, cilia-like hairs along its trunk, producing a sound that targets the minds of any close enough to hear it. This enticing drone causes those under its sway to approach the base of the tree where the umdhlebi can strike. Although the majority of an umdhlebi grows aboveground, the creature's mouth and digestive system are just below the surface. Large, thick roots at the base provide stability and allow for movement, but between these larger roots and beneath the umdhlebi's central trunk exists a populous network of long, thin stems. Each of these growths ends in double-sided fronds lined with spine-like teeth, similar to the leaves of a flytrap. When an umdhlebi roots itself to the ground, these stems burrow up to breach the surrounding earth, forming a moss-like border around the larger roots. Fresh kills are thus devoured from beneath, as the umdhlebi's understems feed. Numbering in the thousands, the umdhlebi's tiny mouths can strip a human carcass to its bones in under an hour, and although these under-stems are too small to effectively damage foes in melee, their shifting, undulating motion of makes traversing the ground around an umdhlebi difficult. Umdhlebis produce a spiny red fruit twice a year. This fruit appears similar to the seed pods of chestnut trees, but instead of holding tough seeds, it contains a bland meat riddled with dozens of triangular seeds. While wellfed umdhlebis sometimes allow monkeys and birds to pluck their fruit and carry it to new ground, they often use their own tendrils to pick and fling the fruit where they please. Some stories tell of undhlebis braining wanderers with these dense pods, or of passersby warned of the dangerous plants by their flying fruit, but these seasonal growths never reliably serve as weapons or warnings. Some tribes maintain dangerous traditions of seeking out and collecting undhlebi fruit to use in the creation of mashes or alcohols. Such products possess a distinctive dry-bitter taste and so are only prepared for use in coming-of-age rituals or other rites of passage. Habitat & Society Umdhlebis root themselves along roads and waterways near humanoid settlements whenever possible. As their roots are highly sensitive to vibrations and can detect the movement of other nearby creatures, they can stay out of sight, despite their size, and still be aware of their surroundings. As the dry shell of their outer layer is particularly susceptible to fire, umdhlebis always entwine themselves with surrounding foliage so that any such attacks against them also risk setting the entire wilderness ablaze. If threatened and such cover is not available, umdhlebis use their compelling whisper ability to manipulate one or more opponents and then draw them in to surround the plant's trunk, using them as living shields. Although they have no use for treasure, umdhlebis pile any leftover items from their prey into the base of their trunks as bait for passersby. When an umdhlebi moves on to other hunting grounds, it sheds its fruit first, hoping that the seeds will take hold and grow. Denizens of the Mwangi Expanse and other jungles are taught to recognize and burn umdhlebi seeds from an early age. Nevertheless, some umdhlebi seeds do make their way into the earth and take root, reaching maturity with frightening speed.\"},\n",

       "   'description': \"In the earliest days of the Age of Serpents, when the great serpentfolk empire was young, the serpentfolk were ruled by a single, powerful priest-king. When Ydersius took his rightful place as god of the serpentfolk, he exalted this priest-king above all others, raising the king up to become his foremost servant and herald. With his original name long lost to memory, the first king of the serpentfolk empire became known as the Emperor of Scales. With Ydersius's still-living head entombed beneath the earth and his mindless body endlessly wandering the Darklands, the Emperor of Scales is the snake-god's primary representative on Golarion. Unable to take direct action on his own, Ydersius relies upon his herald to enact his will on the Material Plane. The Emperor of Scales embodies the fall of the mighty serpentfolk empire from its previous heights, and personifies the rage of Ydersius himself, trapped and sundered into two lesser parts. But he also represents the god's immortality, for even in defeat Ydersius was not slain, and even without a body, the Emperor of Scales still serves. The Emperor of Scales does not speak, but it can communicate telepathically. Snakes and serpents of all kinds and sizes flock to the Emperor of Scales, who can enslave them to his will. The Emperor of Scales appears as a giant snake's head about 20 feet long, and weighs close to 5 tons. His serpentine tendrils extend another 15 feet behind and around his head. Ecology When Ydersius was whole and walked Golarion as the god of the serpentfolk empire, the Emperor of Scales appeared as a giant serpentfolk warrior clad in golden scale armor who strode across ancient battlefields wielding spells and blade with equal precision. When Ydersius was beheaded by the Azlanti heroine Savith and cast down, the Emperor of Scales suffered his own mutilation. In a sympathetic ref lection of his master's fate, the Emperor's head tore itself free from his body, growing to monstrous size while his humanoid body quickly withered away. His eyes clouded over, blinding the herald, but the tendrils of flesh that once attached his head to his body transformed into a multitude of hissing, poisonous vipers. The Emperor of Scales has kept that form since, but the faithful of Ydersius believe that when the snake-god is restored, so too will his herald return to his original form and once more lead the serpentfolk armies to victory. Originally born on Golarion, the Emperor of Scales is a native outsider. He sleeps like any normal creature, and when not called upon to serve, spends most of his time in a dream-filled torpor, much like the severed head of Ydersius himself. Unlike other native outsiders, however, the Emperor of Scales does not need to eat. As he no longer has a body to process and digest food, he gains sustenance from his divine link with Ydersius. On other planes, the Emperor of Scales gains the extraplanar subtype, and requires neither food nor sleep. Habitat & Society At the height of Ydersius's power, the Emperor of Scales divided his time between Golarion and Ydersius's planar realm, the pocket plane of Sydrixus deep in the unending chaos of the Maelstrom. Since Ydersius's defeat, that realm has been closed to both the god and his servants, and like Ydersius, the Emperor of Scales has been confined to the Material Plane. In the millennia since, the Emperor of Scales has traveled throughout the Material Plane, alternately searching the Darklands of Golarion for the sundered skull and body of Ydersius, or sleeping for centuries, dreaming of his master's restoration and return. The Emperor of Scales has been encountered numerous times over the ages in various abandoned cities of the ancient serpentfolk, both on Golarion, and some say, on other worlds as well. Powerful priests of Ydersius have been known to wake the Emperor of Scales when they find him and request his aid. Such alliances are usually short-lived, however, as the herald inevitably moves on in search of his lost master. The Emperor of Scales is known to work with demons on occasion, though those fiends serving Abraxas are viewed as enemies, and the herald does not hesitate to attack and destroy them, returning them to their Abyssal realm. In his original form, the Emperor of Scales frequently mated with mortal serpentfolk and left behind countless semidivine progeny. What happened to these paragons of the serpentfolk race after the fall of the serpentfolk empire is unknown, although many powerful serpentfolk priests claim descent from the herald to bolster their own inf luence. These days, exceptionally large or particularly strong snakes are said to be the brood of the Emperor of Scales, remnants of his serpentine tendrils that were severed in battle and took on a life of their own. Whether or not these claims are true is of little importance-certainly the Emperor of Scales himself seems unconcerned with such potential offspring.\"},\n",

       "   'description': \"Among the many manifestations of serpentfolk faith, the hollow serpent represents one of the most horrific harbingers of doom. Serpentfolk legend suggests Ydersius created the first hollow serpents as protectors and guardians for their underground enclaves. But serpentfolk priests soon learned how to make more, worshiping and cultivating the skin sheddings of monstrously giant snakes with rituals to turn them into engines of destruction. Capable of laying waste to entire regions, the hollow serpents used their life-draining coils to slay the enemies of the serpentfolk, proving particularly effective against the Azlanti empire in the early years of the serpentfolk's age-long struggle against humanity. Eventually, however, the Azlanti learned to combat these skins with positive energy and fire. With the retreat of the mighty snake-god and his people into the shadows of the Darklands, serpentfolk priests have hoarded the most potent of these defenders as guardians of the hibernation chambers of the serpentfolk elite. A typical hollow serpent measures a little over 15 feet long and weighs 500 pounds. A lesser hollow serpent is 7 feet long and weighs just 90 pounds. Ecology As undead creatures, hollow serpents require nothing in the way of sustenance, but their voracious appetite for the life-energy of living creatures is well documented in the annals of Azlanti and serpentfolk lore. The temporary energy derived from their life-draining coils sends most hollow serpents into a feeding frenzy. And their lifesense ability helps them search out even the most well-hidden prey. Much like the predator snakes they mimic, hollow serpents enjoy the hunt and may stalk living creatures for days through the subterranean passageways of the Darklands or the ruined cities of the serpentfolk. Only the high priests of Ydersius know the proper rituals and ceremonies to infuse a shedding with enough divine magic to awaken it into a hollow serpent. However, a hollow serpent also possesses the means to create lesser offspring from its own desiccated flesh. These lesser hollow serpents are much smaller and limited in power, but their undersized nature allows them to venture into passageways a larger hollow serpent could never reach. Serpentfolk priests have also learned how to create these lesser hollow serpents using snakeskin sheddings from normal constrictor snakes, imbuing them with unlife as temple guardians. To spawn a lesser hollow serpent, a hollow serpent must undergo a molting cycle that lasts 3 months. Prior to this hibernation, it must also inf lict no less than nine negative levels on living creatures, storing up the temporary energy from these life-draining attacks to pass onto its new offspring. Thereafter, the hollow serpent sheds a piece of its own skin, which then grows into a lesser hollow serpent. Habitat & Society Hollow serpents have little in the way of society or culture of their own. Beholden to the snake-god, who grants their existence, they exist only to serve and defend the serpentfolk species. Lesser hollow serpents spawned by a hollow serpent intuitively stay near their progenitor-somehow interconnected through the negative energy and siphoned life forces shared between them. Spellcasters who create a lesser hollow serpent on their own may only command its loyalty if capable of commanding undead. Creating a Hollow Serpent While the first hollow serpents were supposedly created from scales shed by beasts favored by the Serpent King himself, and those unholy snakeskins can even shed their own lesser offspring over time, serpentfolk priests can also create their own lesser hollow serpents. A lesser hollow serpent created by a serpentfolk priest requires a more involved process. The priest must fill a clay pot with dirt taken from a serpentfolk grave, the skin and bones of a giant constrictor snake, an onyx gem worth at least 250 gp, and a sprinkling of unholy water. Thereafter, a 15thlevel caster must cast create undead on the skin stuffed with the other assembled reagents.\"},\n",

       "   'description': \"Beheaded are floating skulls or severed heads whose bodies have long since abandoned them, either in the moment of death or long after. Reanimated via dark magic, these horrors are usually created as mindless sentinels for dungeons or lairs. Beheaded silently hover at about eye-level, often making them the last thing a casual wanderer or careless villager in an infested area ever sees. Creating Beheaded Spellcasters might create and employ beheaded in multiple ways. Animating Beheaded: A magic-user can create any form of beheaded from a severed head of the appropriate size or creature. The spellcaster must cast the spell animate dead using an onyx gem worth at least 100 gp, followed by the spell fly on the head to be animated. The creator can only create a number of Hit Dice of beheaded equal to the amount allowed by animate dead. Beheaded with the variant abilities below can also be created, though for the purposes of how many can be created, they are treated as if they had one additional Hit Die for each additional ability. Beheaded count against the number of Hit Dice of skeletons or zombies that can be created using animate dead and vise versa. Beheaded Familiars: Using the Improved Familiar feat, a spellcaster can gain an obedient severed head as a familiar. The character must be at least caster level 3rd to acquire the severed head. This creature is always neutral evil. Although any type of magic-user with the proper requisites can take a severed head as a familiar, necromancers and undead wizards employ them most frequently. Variant Beheaded The following are variant abilities that a beheaded might possess. These traits can be mixed and matched in any way and applied to any of the beheaded listed above. Each ability increases the CR of the beheaded by the listed amount. Belching (+1 CR): A belching beheaded gains the ability to spew raw energy from its mouth, giving it a ranged touch attack that does 1d6 damage of a specific type (acid, cold, electric, or fire) chosen at the time of the beheaded's animation. Burning (+1 CR): This beheaded is similar to the flaming skull; however, the fire not only surrounds the skull, but can pass on to those it attacks. The fire that consumes the head can be any color the animator chooses, though blue is one of the most common. A burning skull gains the burn (1d6) special ability when using its slam attack, where the Reflex save DC is 10 +1/2 the burning skull's racial HD +the burning skull's Cha modifier. Grabbing (+0 CR): This type of beheaded has long tendrils of ragged hair. It gains the grab special ability when using its slam attack, and can attempt to grapple any creature of Medium size or smaller in this way Screaming (+0 CR): Once every 1d4 rounds, a screaming beheaded can open its jaw and emit a bone-chilling scream. All creatures within 30 feet must make a Will save or be shaken for 1d4 rounds. The save DC is equal to 10 +1/2 the screaming skull's racial HD +the screaming skull's Cha modifier. This is a sonic mind-affecting fear effect. Whether or not the save is successful, an affected creature is immune to the same beheaded's scream for 24 hours.\"},\n",

       "   'description': 'Born of mysterious origins and raised by unknowing foster parents, changelings are the children of hags and their tricked lovers. Most do not know of their monstrous origins, but there comes a time in every changeling\\'s life when these roots begin to call out to their host, urging the confused girl toward some end she cannot identify. Changelings are always female, tall, and slender. A changeling\\'s hair is typically dark and her skin abnormally pale, but she otherwise looks for all practical purposes like a member of her father\\'s race. A frequent but not universal trait of changelings is their mismatched, different-colored eyes. Upon reaching puberty and adulthood, the average changeling stands approximately 5-1/2 feet tall and weighs about 110 pounds. Ecology When a hag of any sort conceives a child with a man, the result is a changeling. The male parent is usually eaten or killed by his partner before he can see the offspring, or else flees the area in shame upon discovering the true nature of his lover, and the hag herself interacts with the child just long enough to set it on the stoop of some unsuspecting family or temple. Depending on the race of her father, a changeling can resemble any type of humanoid, including dwarves, gnomes, and even orcs and goblins. A changeling and her new family are never aware of the strange child\\'s true parents, but in most cases everyone involved is keenly aware that there is something odd about the frail child with the ghostly pallor. Even the young girl herself can easily see that she possesses abilities others do not-powers that are subtle at younger ages and only truly begin to manifest themselves when she reaches adolescence. It is around puberty that the changeling begins to hear what hags refer to as \"the call,\" a hypnotic, spiritual voice that only she can hear and that beckons her to travel. To where, the changeling does not know, but the underlying prospect of finding out her true origins is often enough to drive the girl to seek out the source of this mystical voice. The voice is in fact that of the changeling\\'s birth mother, who forms a coven with two others hags in order to summon her child back to her, now that she is old enough to fully transform into a hag. This transformative ritual is a barbaric one that only the most determined changelings willingly go through; upon arriving at the coven, it is usually too late to turn back for changelings who were merely drawn to the voice by curiosity. Those who seek power, however, identify with the hags, and happily go through the ordeal in order to unlock their dormant abilities. Regardless of her desires, though, a changeling who has undergone the transformation cannot go back; once she becomes a hag, she remains a hag, and her mind turns as wicked as her form has turned hideous. Changelings who ignore the call eventually cease to hear it. In this case, a hag mother sometimes disguises herself and ventures into civilization, seeking out her daughter. If she finds her, she lures the girl back to the coven, where she can perform the ritual of transformation. The process of performing the call or physically retrieving the changeling is taxing, though, and many hags find it easier to simply lure in another mate and birth another changeling in hopes that this one will heed the evertantalizing call. Habitat & Society Raised wherever she will be accepted, a changeling has no real say in the habitat she grows up in. Families who inadvertently raise changelings often react in one of two ways toward the strange child\\'s development of supernatural powers: they either embrace the girl, nurturing her and her gift, or they disown her as an abomination, casting her out into a world of loneliness and resentment. Of course, this reaction to her power often has a huge inf luence over the changeling\\'s course of action as a young adult. Changelings who are accepted by their adopted society often don\\'t see the need to follow their mothers\\' voices, instead using their powers for their own ends, whereas shunned individuals almost always answer the call and become treacherous hags with embittered hearts and shattered souls. Hags usually prefer to mate with the prevalent and fecund humans of Golarion, producing changelings that resemble humans. Changelings of other races do occur, but their attitude and outlook are much more dependent on the attitudes of their adoptive parents than on their racial background. Changelings rarely band together with other changelings, as hags only seldom allow their unions to result in offspring, and changelings encountering others of their type may never recognize their shared origins. Thus, the abandoned offspring graft themselves into whatever society will accept them, adapting to new roles with remarkable ease. If a changeling chooses to heed the call that beckons her as a young woman, she quickly finds herself in an entirely different sort of society: hags, though accepting of their own brood, are quite unlike any other creatures, and their form of culture is so primitive and evil that it can hardly be called culture at all. A changelingturned-hag follows the same patterns as her mother and other brethren, eventually charming an unwitting suitor and creating a changeling offspring of her own, repeating the vicious cycle. Having no innate predisposition toward evil, a changeling\\'s values are solely a product of her environment, and any given individual is just as likely to perform evil as she is to act righteously. Often, though, a changeling\\'s slightly unusual appearance marks her as the target for harassment, potentially leading her toward a vengeful path. Any means of releasing innate magical energy is good enough for the changeling, and many become witches. Changeling Characters Changelings are defined by their class levels-they do not possess racial Hit Dice. All changelings have the following racial traits. -2 Constitution, +2 Wisdom, +2 Charisma: Changelings are frail, but possess a sharp wit and unnatural beauty. Hag Trait: A changeling possesses one of the following traits, depending on the type of hag her mother is. Hulking Changeling: A changeling who was born of an annis hag is much more physically formidable than other changelings. You receive a +1 trait bonus on any damage you inf lict with a melee attack. Green Widow: A changeling of green hag descent is naturally able to lure in potential mates and effectively trick them into pursuing her. You gain a +2 trait bonus on Bluff checks made against characters that might be sexually attracted to you. Sea Lungs: A changeling with a sea hag mother can survive underwater for longer than usual. You gain the ability to hold your breath for a number of rounds equal to three times your Constitution score instead of two. Claws: A changeling\\'s hands and fingernails tend to harden and become sharp as she reaches adolescence. This gives her the claw (1d4) natural attack. Natural Armor: Hags and their offspring have uncommonly tough skin. A changeling begins play with a natural armor bonus of +1. Darkvision: Changelings can see in the dark up to 60 feet. Languages: Changelings begin play speaking the primary language of their host society and Common. Changelings who have high Intelligence scores can choose from among the following bonus languages: Aklo, Draconic, Dwarven, Elven, Giant, Gnoll, Goblin, and Orc.'},\n",

Rumors that charau-ka clerics have perfected a hideous ritual to force those slain to reincarnate as new charau-ka are popular tales among jungle explorers-but proof of such a magic spell has yet to reach civilization. Today, the charau-ka are one of the most fecund and widespread races of creatures in the Mwangi Expanse. Not all of them serve the Gorilla King or worship Angazhan; some have become feral monsters little more organized than apes, while others may have turned to the worship of other demon lords or even the snake-god Ydersius. Charau-ka generally dwell in small tribes of a few dozen members. They often keep dangerous jungle creatures as pets or guardians, trusting to their druids or animal handlers to keep the deadly beasts under control. A typical charau-ka village extends from the jungle floor up into the canopy above, and usually includes several treehouse-style structures connected by vines or rope bridges.'},\n",

When Earthfall struck Golarion and the continent of Azlant was shattered, most of the Azlanti dwelling died in the fires or drowned in the waves. Yet a number found succor with their undersea aboleth enemies. For reasons that remain unknown to this day (but which surely have nothing to do with compassion), the aboleths rescued a small fraction of these drowning humans, warping their flesh to help them survive in the aboleths\\' uncontested undersea realm. Yet with that action, the aboleths seemed to lose interest, and in the thousands of years that followed, the gillmen formed a society of their own. Physically, gillmen resemble their ancient ancestors, with expressive brows, pale skin, dark hair, and bright purple eyes. Three slim gills mark each side of their necks, near the shoulder, but they are close enough in appearance to humans that they can pass as such (for a time) without fear of detection. Gillman Characters Gillmen are defined by their class levels-they do not possess racial Hit Dice. All gillmen have the following racial traits. +2 Constitution, +2 Charisma, -2 Wisdom: Gillmen are vigorous and beautiful, but their domination by the aboleths has made them weak-willed. Amphibious: Gillmen have the aquatic subtype, but can breathe both water and air. They prefer not to spend long periods out of the water, however, as their skin dries out very easily. Enchantment Resistance: See above. Servitor: Gillmen serve the dark, unfathomable schemes of the reclusive aboleths, but unless the gillmen go against the orders of their aboleth masters (which are often unknown to them, masked in the form of hidden memories triggered by key events), they are free to act as they wish. In a campaign, these orders are wholly up to the GM, meaning the player of a gillman character cedes some elements of self-control when it best serves the story of the campaign. Water Dependent: See above. Languages: Gillmen begin play speaking Common and Aboleth. Gillmen with high Intelligence scores can choose any of the following bonus languages: Aklo, Aquan, Azlanti, Draconic, Elven, and Sahuagin.'},\n",

Of course, a spine dragon is much more than a predator. As with many true dragons, spine dragons are particularly vain and enjoy being groveled to. It\\'s not uncommon for them to assume the role of god for ignorant tribes of giants. They also have a particular love of crystalline treasure and magic items-a spine dragon\\'s horde is usually sparse on the classic \"carpet of coins\" but just as valuable overall in content as those of true dragons.

       "   'description': 'Treerazer, the self-styled Lord of the Blasted Tarn, was once the favored minion and lieutenant (some even say child) of Cyth-V\\'sug, Demon Lord of Fungus and Parasites. After a failed attempt to wrest that crown away from Cyth-V\\'sug, Treerazer fled to the Material Plane. Cyth-V\\'sug was unable (or perhaps only unwilling) to pursue, but took steps to ensure that Treerazer would remain there by exiling him, transforming Treerazer into a native outsider and severing his bond to the Abyss-if the Lord of the Blasted Tarn is slain, his animus will not return to the Abyss and reform. Death, to Treerazer, is a permanent thing. Treerazer arrived on Golarion near the end of the Age of Darkness, and found the savaged planet much to his liking-so much so that the sting of exile was somewhat ameliorated. He spent many centuries wandering the remote corners of Golarion before finally coming upon the abandoned elven nation of Kyonin in 2497 ar. In the Sovyrian Stone, he found an artifact that he believed he could use to reinstate his Abyssal link and, perhaps, even uproot the entire nation and refocus the portal from Sovyrian to the Abyss, thereby reclaiming his position there and taking one more step toward revenge against Cyth-V\\'sug. Yet the elves sensed his tamperings and returned to confront the demon. A terrific battle resulted, and while the elves were able to drive Treerazer out of Iadara and into southern Kyonin, they were unable to slay him or force him out completely-they merely concentrated his power in a smaller region. Instead, the elves \"walled off \" this region, a perverted realm known today as the Tanglebriar. Treerazer lurks at the Tanglebriar\\'s heart to this day, the greatest bogeyman in elven mythology and a very real and constant threat to the nation\\'s security. Treerazer begins most combats by casting time stop and raising an antiplant shell to prevent plant creatures (including creatures under the effect of his aura of corruption) from approaching. If he has time, he also creates walls of thorns and summons demons (usually four nalfeshnees and 12 hezrous). In melee, Treerazer gleefully takes up Blackaxe and makes full attacks against the closest foe, or Greater Vital Strikes if he\\'s forced to move or charge. During the first 3 rounds of combat, he targets obvious spell effects with quickened greater dispel magic. If Treerazer is reduced to fewer than 150 hit points, he teleports back to his fortress, Witchbole, to recover and plan his revenge. Treerazer\\'s Cult Cults of Treerazer are quite rare beyond Kyonin, where secret cabals of cultists venerate him. When they do appear beyond these borders, they are secretive but sadistic groups, eager to sacrifice nonbelievers yet cunning in remaining undetected by the law of the land. Treerazer\\'s symbol is a bleeding dead tree that\\'s been split in half. His clerics have access to the Domains of Chaos, Destruction, Evil, and Plant. His favored weapon is the battleaxe.'},\n",

       "   'description': 'A distant cousin of shambling mounds, borutas are powerful wielders of natural magic that make their homes in marshes or wetlands, where their mysterious control over the natural environment is most useful. Though none are sure of the specific relationship between borutas and shambling mounds, the connection is clear when comparing the two, their powers and affinity for the marshlands being the most obvious similarities. Borutas-or \"swamp lords,\" as they\\'re sometimes called-resemble mossy, skeletal humans at first glance, with bonelike wooden frames, viny covering, and vivid yellow eyes. Considerably more intelligent than their shambling mound cousins, they claim wide territories-typically swamps, forests, jungles, or other lands thick with plant-life-and brook no insult to their realm. Highly defensive of the life within their lands, especially plants and thinking plant creatures, borutas view themselves as the avengers of those that can\\'t defend themselves, and mercilessly repay destructive invaders with verdurous force. On the rare occasions when they deal peaceably with non-plant creatures, borutas cover their frightening forms with thick veils of grass or peat moss. Borutas generally stand about 7 feet tall and weigh just over 200 pounds. Ecology Surfacing from the dark waters of bogs and marshes, borutas are birthed from swamps and forested caves in isolated pods. Cocooned in a thick shell of reeds and swampy grasses, a boruta grows inside its own chamber until it reaches maturity, about 2 years after the emergence of the pod. Upon reaching this stage of maturity, a swamp lord breaks out of its protective shell fully grown. Though formidable upon emergence, infant borutas are incredibly vulnerable while developing in their cocoons. If the shell-like pod is ruptured before development is complete, the boruta within ceases to grow, usually causing it to simply wither away. Few can say where borutas come from, though some claim that natural lands threatened with destruction or with strong ties to the First World produce them. A boruta\\'s viny flesh typically takes a greenish hue, though these colors change with the natural progression of the seasons or to otherwise blend in with the foliage of its homeland. As a boruta ages, its leaves continues to darken, and the most ancient swamp lords possess foliage almost as black as the murky waters from which they emerge. How long a boruta might survive, no one knows, as the reclusive creatures sometimes vanish into their fecund homes and aren\\'t seen for decades. Some propose the creatures are immortal-or at least have life spans on par with the oldest trees-so long as the territory they watch over remains healthy. Habitat & Society Borutas hold plant and animal life in the same esteem as humans typically hold members of their own race or other sentient creatures. As sentient plants, borutas share kinship with the oldest trees and slightest blades of grass in their territories, viewing all as members of their extended family and watching over all. Their manner of thinking and philosophies differ wildly from these of humanoids, being far more fundamentally tied into the cycle of seasons and the mysterious rhythms of the earth. Borutas understand that nature is rarely calm or peaceful, and that the mere act of moving can often be disruptive or outright destructive to other organisms, yet do what they can to keep forces outside of nature from disturbing or destroying the environments of their homes. Left to their own devices, they tend to plants and vulnerable animals, commune with the oldest growth and natural creatures of their territories, and encourage new growth. Should their homes be violated, however, whether by the axes of enterprising humanoids or the depredations of rampaging monsters, borutas do all they can to prevent future harm. Sometimes this might mean slaying a dangerous interloper, but in more extreme cases their vengeance might launch an extended campaign of natural violence against an entire community. Borutas try not to harm the innocent, but if they view certain neighboring creatures as fundamentally destructive, or are forced to choose between the lives of invaders and those of their plants, they will always side with nature. Such decisions often put borutas at odds with expanding humanoid communities, leading to tales of violent swamp monsters or evil spirits of the forest, though rarely do such stories consider the plants\\' points of view. Borutas are intelligent enough to reason with, but are stolid in their defense of their lands and will no more accept partial loss or brook lessened defilement of their homes than a community might assent to the murder of a mere fraction of its populace. Borutas rarely encounter others of their kind, being born alone and never leaving their territories of their own accord. They typically find themselves at odds with humanoids, and even the most nature-sensitive elves often find them disagreeable or alien enough to bear avoidance. Druids who know of a boruta in a region typically go out of their way to placate it and serve as peacemakers between the swamp lord and the communities of other humanoids; they often preach avoidance to all who would pass through the proud plant creature\\'s lands. Despite their similar interests in watching over nature, treants rarely share territories with borutas, preferring highly forested lands while the swamp lords tend to favor darker lands and the meaner plants of the forest. When members of the two races do share lands, they might brief ly cooperate in defense of their forest, though treants typically disfavor boruta tactics, which they view as shortsighted and provocative. Fey, too, have mixed opinions of borutas, with goodly fey avoiding them, while the more neutral hold them in high regard. Yet borutas share a special alliance with shambling mounds, treating the wild plants as primitive cousins, often assembling and guiding tribelike communities of the mounds and cooperating with them to drive off those who threaten their lands.'},\n",

       "   'description': \"A sadistic being from the realm of the fey, a skin stealer is a terrifying sight to behold. These blood-red creatures resemble horrid, emaciated humans without skin, their yellowish eyes and teeth suggesting malnourishment or disease. Skin stealers suffer from no ailment, however, except for their insatiable lust for chaos and their hunger for flesh. Hailing from the First World, skin stealers are fey bent on destruction and gruesome murder. When left to their own devices, these gangly beings are unpredictable and spontaneous; when assigned duties from some higher, stronger power, however, skin stealers prove adept at performing complex assassinations and spy work. A skin stealer is a little over 6 feet tall and weighs about 100 pounds, though it can adjust its size to inhabit many different creatures' skins. Ecology Nightmares can come true just as readily as dreams in the First World, and the skin stealer is proof of this. A manifestation of inhabitants' fears and disdain, a skin stealer's primary desires are to deceive, murder, and rob. In a world where inconsistency is the law and little can be trusted anyway, these evil denizens only add to the overwhelming sense of paranoia many travelers feel when thrust into the magical realm of the fey. When a powerful inhabitant of the Material Plane experiences intense feelings of distrust and maliciousness, she can unintentionally draw out a skin stealer from the First World-often whilst sleeping-under the guise of a nightmare. Thus, an unwitting evoker of such a dark being awakens cold and sweaty, unaware of the chaotic fey now causing mayhem outside her chamber walls-assuming the bandit hasn't already made off with her flesh yet. Skin stealers possess few items of their own, as they derive absolutely no pleasure from material goods, and often times the only thing one will carry is a sharp object. Though their claws-thick and unsightly as they are-are formidable weapons, they are not ideal tools when it comes to flaying victims. Thus, many skin stealers use rusty knives or crude blades as their scalpels. Most skin stealers would revel in the agony that skinning victims alive would cause, but the simple fact of the matter is that stripping a subject's flesh is too difficult while the victim is still alive. It is out of convenience, rather than any sense of mercy, that a skin stealer slays a target before performing its barbaric reinterpretation of surgery. Though most think of skin stealers as nothing more than mindless killing machines with a quirky habit of peeling the skin off victims, the truth is grimmer. In addition to their affinity for grisly murders, skin stealers also possess a love of trickery, delighting in the chaos they can create through impersonating political leaders they have slain or the havoc they can wreak while wearing the flesh of a trusted guard or advisor. Where a skin stealer goes, there is not only death, but confusion as well. The techniques skin stealers employ while preparing a hide for use would inspire the envy and admiration of fur trappers if the act were not so heinous. Even more remarkable than their style of flaying, perhaps, is their supernatural ability to preserve the flesh of victims for lengthy periods of time. Skin stealers fold the fleshy suit of a victim into an impressively compact pouch that they can fit into any fist-sized pocket or pouch. Realizing the benefits of possessing multiple hides, skin stealers tend to wear clothes with numerous compartments, making adventurers and traveling merchants particularly susceptible to having their skins and outfits stolen. Skin stealers' own flesh looks similar to the muscular layer beneath most humanoids' epidermis. This outer layer is so taut that it allows skin to perfectly adhere to it. The malleable vocal cords of a skin stealer are located on the outside of its throat-when it dons the flesh of another being, it captures that creature's voice's tone and inf lection by shaping its own neck muscles so as to fit its host's perfectly. The slightest bump or agitation may disturb the sensitive vocal lining, however, and one of the most common giveaways of a skin stealer in disguise is an abrupt crack in its speech or a shift in register. A skin stealer does not die of old age; instead, it continually wanders whatever plane it may have found itself upon until it is slain, at which time it returns to the First World to be reborn into the cosmic energy comprising its native realm. Habitat & Society Often used by powerful entities of the First World as spies, assassins, and agents of havoc, skin stealers excel at espionage as well as cold-blooded murder. On the Material Plane, skin stealers are much more difficult to partner with, their lust for flesh only heightened by the plethoric array of new available suits. However, if one can garner the respect of a skin stealer (usually only possible through intimidation or coercion), one has found a powerful ally. When a skin stealer emerges from the First World onto the Material Plane, it immediately tries to find a host for its horrid form, knowing full well that exposure could lead to its swift eradication. Fortunately for the wretched fey, it usually arrives via the unhindered emotions of a hapless dreamer rapt in torturous visions or night terrors. This helpless subject makes for an easy first target, and a skin stealer may inhabit this individual's flesh for several days while it gathers its bearings and studies the immediate world around it. Skin stealers rarely stay in one spot long, however. Their love of mayhem often turns a place of peace into one of bedlam, and it behooves a skin stealer to continue alternating between different suits of skin, both to perpetuate chaos and to mask its identity. When people begin to suspect the gruesome bandit or catch it in its gory work, it hastily leaves the area in search of new, unsuspecting victims. Skin stealers do not collaborate or work together unless a higher power forces them to do so. Their self ish predispositions and individualistic tactics make teamwork diff icult, and planned assassinations tend to go better when performed by a lone skin stealer. Just as useful, though, are skin stealers who remain at their master's side, so adept are they at identifying doppelgangers and other skin stealers. As skin stealers are masters of disguise as well as flaying, few can bypass their perceptive gaze.\"},\n",

       "   'description': \"The Steward of the Skein is Pharasma's foremost agent in the mortal realm, a mighty warrior sent to restore the balance of fate, announce a particularly auspicious birth or death, or deliver a world-shaking prophecy. Many times her presence on Golarion is as an incorporeal shade, making a pronouncement and then fading away, though countless creatures over the eons have felt the stunning impact of her armored fists. No mortal can recall seeing her in relation to the death of Aroden, and her role as messenger of prophecy has all but disappeared since that time. The Steward is emotionally distant, and seems to have difficulties relating to mortals. Some speculate that she was driven slightly mad by the Last Azlanti's death, and others believe she sees the past, present, and future simultaneously, leading her to treat mortals as temporary objects in the skein of fate, much the way a beekeeper has little regard for individual bees. When viewed by a Medium or Small creature, she always appears to be exactly the same height as the viewer, though her size does not change, and the few documented sightings of her by larger creatures describe her as no more than 6 feet tall. Ecology The Steward is timeless and ageless, and capable of patiently waiting hundreds of years for a particular event to occur. She has been found deep underground, standing silently like a golem, only to snap to attention when a particular individual approaches, delivering her message and then vanishing. She has likewise appeared in cities or remote areas, ignoring all who speak to her, stunning those who try to harm her, and waiting for the right time to speak. It is unknown why Pharasma has her act this way rather than appearing at the necessary time, but her priests believe the herald's presence is enough to align the strands of fate to suit the goddess' will, much as standing in a stream can change the course of a floating leaf. On at least two occasions she has waited in a prominent Pharasmin temple, rarely reaching out to bless the faithful, and in one case a loyal member of the church found her standing in a field and built a temple around her. The Steward only kills when it is Pharasma's will. She prefers to use her stunning gaze, her charm and hold magic, and similar nonlethal methods for dealing with opponents, giving them ample opportunities to flee. She is sparse with her healing, only using it to save those who Pharasma needs for future events-when present at great battles in history, she healed only a few, and restored but one or two who had recently died. The herald is ruthless when dealing with the undead, however, blasting them with her full power. Habitat & Society The Steward is a loner and has little interest in the desires of mortals. She is more personable with other planar servitors of her creator, but her unique role places her above them in the religious hierarchy, and she does not like fraternizing too much with her underlings lest she distract them from what Pharasma has planned for them. Conversely, she is extremely interested when one of the goddess's other servants is due to give birth or die. Though the Steward has no interest in procreating on her own, any celestial or half-celestial birth is especially interesting to her, from both a physical and a spiritual standpoint-perhaps as proxy to Pharasma herself, whose presence would certainly overwhelm the newborn and confuse its role in the tapestry of fate. Likewise, she has an almost morbid curiosity about one of her fellow servitors dying, and has an almost-precognitive sense for such things, making her sudden appearance next to other servants of Pharasma in the Material Plane slightly worrisome. Occasionally she is called to testify in Pharasma's Court about the deeds or fate of a particular soul. When not following a direct order from the goddess, the Steward has been known to travel the planes slaying undead, following the Rivers of Souls and protecting them from greedy daemons and other soul-devouring creatures. She relishes the opportunity to chase and slaughter the outsider minions of Urgathoa, and has torn apart her herald (a flying fanged skull called Mother's Maw) several times.\"},\n",

       "   'description': \"Beings of pure malevolence and destruction, vilkacis arise from the souls of the most desperate and brutal werewolves as spirits burning with the need for bloodshed and vengeance. Specters of savagery escaped from remains tainted by lycanthropy, vilkacis desire to wear mortal flesh and again revel in the vicious ecstasy of hunting and killing. Some see these beings as malign manifestations of the lycanthropic curse-the spirits of the infamous aff liction itself-while others know them as the deathly continuance of lives consumed by lycanthropy. In either case, these ravenous spirit-beasts seek only to garb themselves in the skins of deadly hunters and revel in bloodshed once more. Vilkacis typically look like more savage versions of the werewolves they were in life, appearing in their hybrid forms with exaggerated fangs and claws. Ecology Although a vilkacis exists only in a spectral form, its canopic stone permanently binds the spirit to the Material Plane. So long as the stone exists, the creature remains stuck between life and death, its spirit strangling on its own rage. When a vilkacis seizes possession of a victim, the host takes on an altered appearance ref lective of the beast within its body. The victim undergoes severe physical dysmorphia. Musculature enlarges, posture becomes stooped, and hands curl into gashing claws. The face takes on a bestial appearance. The victim's jaws extend and grow into jagged, wolfish fangs, while the brow thickens and the pupils widen to black pools that radiate a mad, feral stare. In this state, the vilkacis-possessed creature froths with the curse of lycanthropy and can pass the curse on as though it were a werewolf. Although such a possessed creature might pass on the infamous disease, its own transformation typically lasts only a matter of hours. A vilkacis is ever searching for stronger and more vicious hunters to use as tools in slaking its eternal bloodlust; if it finds a particularly promising host, it might visit and possess the favored body again and again for its rampages. Habitat & Society Vilkacis most commonly appear in areas where human settlements border or stand within wildernesses. While they are commonly associated with werewolves, the folklore of many nomadic and nature-worshiping societies contains stories of creatures whose descriptions bear strong resemblance to vilkacis. Most haunt the territories where they were created, staying within range of their canopic stones, and hunting within the lands they prowled in life. However, those with the ability to summon vilkacis usually attempt to direct them toward specific prey. This often proves a dangerous or even fatal proposition, however, and few reports exist of anyone successfully mastering a vilkacis. Creating a Vilkacis While many vilkacis spontaneously arise under the light of the full moon from the remains of the most savage werewolves, some foul spellcasters seek out the corpses of such bestial murderers, attempting to enslave their spirits and harness their capacity for brutality to fulfill the spellcasters' dark whims. To do this, a spellcaster must prepare a canopic stone, a talisman that typically takes the form of a ceramic totem or amulet bound in silver. Upon creating this object, the bearer can summon a vilkacis once per day. The stone grants no control over the vilkacis, but the creature will not attack or attempt to possess the stone's bearer. Upon being summoned, the vilkacis turns its attention to the nearest creature other than the summoner, attempting to possess the creature's body and go on a murderous rampage. Using a canopic stone to summon a vilkacis is considered an evil act. Although many vilkacis are purposefully created and employed by evil spellcasters, some manifest spontaneously. These beings wander and rampage as they please, but still are bound to a talisman similar to a canopic stone. This spontaneously created artifact can be utilized by those who discover it and discern its importance in the same way as can a canopic stone created specifically to summon and control a vilkacis, and typically takes the form of the dead werewolf 's skull, the silver weapon that killed the werewolf, or a talisman it bore in life.

Pale humanoid skin and carapace meld together beneath a face with segmented eyes and mandibles chittering a song of discordant alien clicks and hisses, as overlong carapace claws weave cords of thick webbing between them.\",\n",
       "   'description': 'Foul servants of the goddess of disease and gluttony, weaverworms-or simply \"weavers,\" as they are often called-are terrifying abominations, combining the features of predatory insects, monstrously huge larvae, and deathly pale humanoids. Creations of Urgathoa forgotten by their cruel mistress long ago, these horrors seek out the dark places of the world, sowing murder and fear from the darkness, and all the while raising unnatural songs in praise of the goddess of gluttony. Weaverworms typically measure 18 feet long, though the most bloated weigh upward of a ton. Ecology A weaverworm\\'s lower body is approximately 3 feet in diameter, and is divided into numerous segments that secrete a viscous film. The creature moves by expanding and contracting these segments, giving it an incredible range of motion, as well as the capability to scale surfaces with an ease equal to that with which they move across the ground. Weaverworms are also know for their claws\\' deadly nails, which function more like the stingers or barbs of many insects than weapons alone. These nails contain a potent paralytic fluid that passes into the bloodstream of a weaverworm\\'s victim, leaving it vulnerable to slaughter and ready for consumption. The nails often break off while embedded in the victim\\'s body, where they continue pumping the weaverworm\\'s toxins, filling potential meals with dose after dose of paralytic excretions. Occasionally, those who encounter a weaverworm and flee find themselves paralyzed well after they think they\\'ve escaped, again falling into the deadly clutches of the pursuing abomination. The flesh of the creature\\'s underbelly is relatively soft and slightly rubbery, running in shades of sickly brown flesh to pale blue. The exposed carapace is tougher and dotted with thousands of short bristles. Over time the weaverworm adjusts to match whatever environment it dwells in. The upper portion of the creature has a female body, but one disfigured by insectile traits. Such monstrous malformations vary between weavers, though all have deadly claws and heads with a terrible assortment of mandibles, pincers, spines, and segmented eyes. Typically, these appearances are similar to the faces of predatory insects common to the region the weaverworm inhabits, with spider features proving most prevalent, but the visages of horrible mantises and monstrous annelids also arise in warmer climates. Habitat & Society Much like larger arachnids, weaverworms are chief ly ambush hunters. They live in solitary burrows, near or within old ruins and similar places that tend to attract prey. While they tend to avoid colder climes, they prove resilient to most extremes of weather and terrain, tending to choose somewhat isolated areas where their hunting goes unnoticed. Typically, once a weaverworm claims a burrow, she remains there for life. In this manner, weaverworms are largely consistent, enough so that they frequently catch the attention of primitive humanoids such as goblins, orcs, or, in particular, ettercaps who believe them the embodiment of various gods or fiends and pay them worship. The relationship between weaverworms and their worshipers tends to be brutal, as weaverworms have few qualms about eating worshipers who come too close. Origins Among the vast libraries of mysteries and ancient legends documented and passed on by the faithful of Pharasma is the tale of Lamia of Avalos, a seer of Pharasma from a distant land who blasphemed against the goddess and was transformed into a beastlike creature denied the judgment promised sentient beings in death, as were her sister sibyls. Yet this punishment unleashed greater terror than even the Lady of Graves might have imagined. Unknown to the furious goddess and her false worshipers, another divinity had noticed the tragic drama. Urgathoa, goddess of disease and undeath, watched and laughed at the terror wrought by the goddess of prophecy upon her vicious servants. Delighted and inspired, Urgathoa went into the world to wreak a similar horror. The Pallid Princess searched the world over, and among her servants living and undead, found none who displeased her enough to curse as Pharasma had her priestess. So she turned her mind toward granting a rare and terrible blessing. Deep in a tangled forest she happened upon a brood of maggots and lowly worms, and in them found all she delighted in-filth and disease, hunger and life amid the dead. Momentarily delighted, she raised up this terrible swarm and molded them and gave them a single body, terrible but not unlike her favored daughters. The result was a monster, a servant of hungers and foul dooms, part grotesque insect, part poisonous fanatic. And the goddess was pleased. Yet Urgathoa is a fickle goddess; her momentary pleasure soon passed, and she left her terror in the forest, content to let it praise her, yet unwilling to care for its needs or safety. So the weaverworm crawled through the forest, insane and terrifying, preying upon what she could and sowing new generations in fits of atrocity-all the while plucking out Urgathoa\\'s praises upon strands of deadly webbing.'},\n",

       "   'description': \"The Elder God known in whispered circles as Shub-Niggurath is reputed to have a thousand young, when in fact her spawn are myriad. Yet some of her children are more fecund and successful than others, and the monstrosities known as her dark young are perhaps the best known of this legion of monstrosities. In combat, a dark young usually starts by using entangle and command plants to seize control of the surrounding terrain-its ability to constantly use freedom of movement affords it mobility through such regions, allowing it to move through the areas and select its prey with ease. Intelligent and canny, dark young know that spell-casters are more difficult to affect with insanity, and save that spell-like ability for use against rogues, fighters, and similar foes. Flight offers no guarantee of safety from the dark young, for they can pursue their foes through the air as surely as across land. Ecology A dark young superficially resembles a tree, and while it possesses magic that allows it some ability to appear as a tree or to control the plants of the trackless forests it favors, upon close inspection a dark young is manifestly something far more than a mere tree. Even the smallest of these creatures stand taller than a house, while the largest of them shake the very earth with their cloven hooves and crush cities and forests alike with their passage. A typical dark young of Shub-Niggurath stands nearly 30 feet tall and weighs 12,000 pounds, but many are much larger. While most are encountered in temperate regions, they can also be found in subarctic or tropical forests. These dark young appear no different than their temperatedwelling kin, but when they use their tree shape ability, they assume the forms of plants native to the region. Habitat & Society Dark young prefer to dwell in large wilderness regions, particularly within temperate woodlands or swamps. While their presence amid cults of Shub-Niggurath have given rise to assumptions that these foul lunatics possess strange secrets that allow them to conjure the dark young to serve their cabals as guardians, in fact the reverse is true. Cultists of Shub-Niggurath often seek out the dark young and offer themselves to the creatures in sacrifice, in hopes of either being transported to the embrace of their goddess Shub-Niggurath in the process of being digested or impressing the dark young with their devotion so they might be granted reincarnation as one of them-or simply out of madness. In most cases, these offerings end poorly for the cultist, for the dark young of Shub-Niggurath are ravenous-the numerous sucking mouths that stud their trunks drain blood, drink flesh, and devour life rapidly, causing the victim's body to wither and atrophy. Often, a dark young takes pains to avoid damaging those it grabs and holds against its hungry flanks, for a living, squirming meal is so much more delicious than a lifeless husk. Those drained to zero Strength by a dark young are sometimes left hideously alive, perhaps draped across high branches in a tree where the paralyzed victim has no choice but a slow death from thirst and exposure, or maybe left for hungrier jaws in the woods amid the cloven prints and pools of thick green waste that drain from these creatures as they feed. Yet not all cultists who seek the dark young meet such ends, for some of the dark young have strange needs and uses for mortal minions. These dark young serve as objects of veneration and obsession for their cults, and happily accept their sacrifices in Shub-Niggurath's name, even though most dark young themselves feel no great debt of loyalty to their fecund progenitor. The actual uses the dark young put their cults to vary wildly-these aberrations are quite intelligent, and many have their own goals and plans that are made much easier to achieve with the addition of a blindly loyal cult. Most dark young merely enjoy the idea of being worshiped as a god, while others stand apart from their kin and do feel a strong link to Shub-Niggurath, seeing these cults as a way to honor their inhuman mother with mortal minions. Yet the dark young of Shub-Niggurath are the spawn of a body and mind alien to most forms of mortal life, and as such the majority of these monsters have plans and goals that may seem nonsensical at best (such as a strange desire to drive all avian life from a swamp, or a drive to build a series of stone menhirs in a massive spiral shape recognizable only from absurdly great heights) or wantonly destructive at worst (such as the destruction of all settlements within a mile of a forest's edge). It's rare for the cultists themselves to be privy to the dark young's reasoning, and most worshipers content themselves with their own interpretations of why they serve one of the Thousand Young.\"},\n",

       "   'description': 'The dimensional shambler is a vagabond of the realms between realms. With its ability to shift planes, it is no stranger to the weirdest the Great Beyond has to offer, and despite its brutish and unrefined intellect, its knowledge of the planes and the relationships between dimensions is significant indeed. A dimensional shambler is humanoid in outline, yet it moves with a weird and alien gait that gives it the appearance of a creature not in full possession of its faculties, almost as if it were drunk or horribly wounded. Yet those who mistake this shambling posture as a sign of weakness swiftly learn of their error, for the dimensional shambler is in fact quite agile-the weird lumbering cadence of its movements is simply another outward manifestation of its inhuman countenance. A dimensional shambler typically stands just over 7 feet in height, and weighs 350 pounds. Ecology As outsiders, dimensional shamblers have no need to feed-a trait that comes in handy for a creature that often finds itself adrift or lost in strange realms where food and water does not-or perhaps cannot-exist. They are certainly most at home in regions that function similarly to most Material Plane worlds, for their bodies are built to traverse the ground. They have no inborn ability to fly, cannot breathe water, and possess no unusual resistance to energies, and as such there are many realms throughout the Great Beyond that are dangerous or even deadly to dimensional shamblers. Yet they are masters of traveling the planes, and instinctively avoid appearing in regions that would cause them harm. More powerful dimensional shamblers often seek out magical devices to aid them in traveling the stranger and less hospitable corners of reality. The need a dimensional shambler has for exploring the Great Beyond is not fully understood by mortal scholars. Certainly, curiosity seems to be a large part of their drive-a dimensional shambler can spend weeks or even years simply observing a particularly unusual planar feature, such as the expulsion of raw protolife from the Positive Energy Plane into the surrounding realities, the strange semianimate heavings of an Abyssal swamp giving birth to a legion of demons, or the mind-numbing violence of a reality storm deep in the Maelstrom. As chaotic evil outsiders, they are most comfortable on planes that either have no strong alignment traits or are close to chaotic evil, yet this does not prevent them from exploring realms beyond. The mind of a dimensional shambler, as with its body and mobility, is not quite \"in tune\" with mortal expectations, and it may be that what scholars have assumed is curiosity could be some other driving force. Perhaps the race instinctively travels the Great Beyond in search of a forgotten or hidden goal, or maybe the constant change of reality is something that brings them pleasure or some strange nutrition. Dimensional shamblers generally lack the wits to carry on long philosophical discussions, and are prone to attacking other creatures when they encounter them, so attempts to learn more about this mysterious race through conversation have not resulted in particularly informative results. Habitat & Society Dimensional shamblers seem to have very little interest in others of their kind. While they do not display any instinctual need for violence against others of their ilk when chance brings them together, neither do they seek out their own kind for companionship. Dimensional shamblers are solitary beings, and the majority of their interactions with other forms of life are violent-they are fond of snatching creatures who are capable of comprehending their own peril and whisking them away to remote corners of the multiverse. Those few who have endured these abductions and survived to tell the tale did so either by escaping their captors and hiding, or by slaying the shamblers. In all cases, their return home has involved harrowing journeys through the Great Beyond, for the dimensional shambler is frustratingly skilled at selecting particularly remote and dangerous realms as destinations for its abductions. The fate of the majority of these victims is unknown, although circumstantial evidence indicates that the shambler itself plays a key and grisly role in the victims\\' doom. Spellcasters have long sought to harness the dimensional shambler\\'s ability to accurately travel between planes. Mortal magic has traditionally found this feat a difficult one to master-plane shift is notorious for its inaccuracy, often leaving powerful effects like gate, miracle, or wish as the favored methods of safe interplanar travel. Yet the dimensional shambler seems able to navigate the unnavigable with ease, traveling between incredibly diverse and distant locations with no more difficulty than a human might have stepping out of a house into his own front yard. Unfortunately, the same mastery over dimensional travel that affords shamblers such accurate navigation allows them to resist the call of conjurers with surprising skill. In fact, by the time most spellcasters master the magic required to lure or conjure a dimensional shambler, it is often a simpler matter to use a gate spell instead. Some conjurers claim to have developed methods of attracting dimensional shamblers more easily. Through the use of blood sacrifice via a blade of purest metal and the application of exacting mathematical symbols or other complex combinations of runes, these spellcasters can call upon dimensional shamblers with relative ease. Unfortunately, the exact combination of runes, metals, and bloodshed seems different for every dimensional shambler, so once a spellcaster discovers the correct combination to lure one of these monsters, the secret that caster has uncovered is as closely guarded as her greatest treasures. The nature and availability of these secret rituals are left to the GM to determine, but such a ritual\\'s recipe could well be worth 8,000 gp or more to an interested party.'},\n",

       "   'description': 'The gnoph-keh is a six-legged horned creature vaguely akin to a polar bear in shape and outline, yet possessed of a cruel and creative intellect that elevates it from the rank of wild beast to murderous warmonger. Covered with a dense pelt of shaggy white fur, the gnoph-keh is equally at home walking on two, four, or six legs. The creature prefers to travel on all six when using its powerful charge or running, but rears up on its hind legs in combat to bring its four front claws to bear on its foes. With the gnophkeh\\'s ability to call up and direct powerful blizzards matched to its ability to move and see in such conditions without any disadvantage, the creature is rightfully feared in the frozen realms where it dwells. Ecology The gnoph-keh is, and always has been, a beast of the frozen white realms. Temperatures above freezing are uncomfortable to the gnoph-keh, to the extent that prolonged exposure to warm or hot temperatures can actually kill this mighty creature. Its aura of cold helps to protect it somewhat when it ventures into temperate areas, but once in a subtropical or similarly heated environment, the monster\\'s freezing body cannot compensate-its flesh begins to literally melt, as if it were composed of ice and snow. The gnoph-keh has watery blue blood, and as it melts, this pale fluid runs in copious, steaming gouts from its body, inf licting severe pain on the creature. Accounts of gnoph-kehs being driven to blind rage in such conditions and simply attacking all nearby creatures and objects with no attempt to seek safety are likely apocryphal, since a gnoph-keh presented with such extreme temperatures generally does everything in its power to flee. They can use their ability to create blizzards to delay this fate, but in hot areas, the fact that this ability lasts only a minute usually only postpones the inevitable. Although once much more numerous, gnoph-kehs today are spread quite thin through the frozen wastelands and mountain heights they prefer to dwell in. This, combined with the creatures\\' long gestation period, means that few gnoph-kehs are born. The monsters are exceptionally long-lived, with all indications that they can survive for centuries, or even millennia, if not slain by sickness or violence. Gnoph-kehs typically only seek out others of their kind for two reasons-to mate (an event that generally happens only once a century for any single gnoph-keh) or to make war. Gnoph-kehs are hermaphrodites, capable of fertilizing others of their kind while also capable of becoming pregnant (although they cannot fertilize themselves). Despite its resemblance to a mammal, the gnoph-keh does not birth live young-instead, it lays a clutch of a dozen or so furry eggs that it buries in the snow or in the ice of a glacier. As the eggs grow, they slowly absorb each other until finally only a single egg remains. The creature inside doesn\\'t hatch as much as it simply absorbs the leathery, furry sphere that surrounds it, transforming into a fully grown gnoph-keh. Habitat & Society The primary driving force behind gnoph-keh society is war-not between themselves, but against other creatures that share their realms. Whether this drive to wage war is rooted in a strange psychological need, spurred by racial memories of the creatures\\' interactions with even more hostile races in the distant past, or something else entirely, there can be no denying that the gnoph-kehs enjoy the act of spreading misery to other races-particularly to humanoids. The only times a gnophkeh interacts with one of these \"lesser races\" is to subjugate it for the purposes of establishing an army that the gnoph-kehs can then use against similar races, for the only thing that eclipses a gnoph-keh\\'s lust for warfare is the delight in turning tribes against each other. Once one tribe wipes out all of its competitors, the inevitable result is the final destruction of the victorious tribe by its own hateful commander. In this way, a single gnoph-keh can eradicate far larger groups than it would normally be able to destroy on its own. While gnoph-keh society may seem monolithic to humanity, this is largely due to the simple fact that most of humanity\\'s interactions with the gnoph-kehs are in the framework of pain and death. And while gnoph-kehs do not usually gather in groups or build cities, there is evidence that this is not always the case in certain strange and ancient ruins found in frozen corners of the world. Most gnoph-kehs spend their time alone in contemplation or worship of strange statues they carve from glaciers or frozen lakes. The countenances of these gnoph-keh gods are alien and frightening. Very few gnoph-keh clerics or other divine spellcasters exist, prompting some scholars to theorize that these statues are in fact effigies of a long-forgotten and even more terrible force-perhaps the same one that nearly drove the gnoph-kehs into extinction so long ago and instilled in their minds such an overwhelming predisposition for war.'},\n",

       "   'description': 'A spawning canker is a terrible dual creature, an unnatural parasite and the decapitated humanoid body its tentacles writhe from like a knot of lashing, aberrant heads. Few ever see a spawning canker without its humanoid armor, but within the chest cavity of these hollowed-out hosts squirms a heartlike body contorting with a misassembled mass of fetal features and trailing a thicket of spiny tendrils. These tendrils lash from the stump of the host body\\'s exploded head, but also riddle the body, taking control of muscles and organs like the strings of some abominable puppet master. The body of a former host is pumped full of strange excretions and reinforced with the tendrils riddling its form, giving what appears to be a crippled frame an unnatural strength and speed. Those tentacles that extend forth serve as both the thing\\'s sensory organs and its feeding tubes, through which a canker drains the essence of other thinking creatures. Once it has gorged itself, a spawning canker erupts in a burst of obscene generation, its body withering with terrible speed, splitting both its own and its stolen essence into tentacles. These limbs split and tear from the remains of the canker\\'s body as writhing, dumb slugspawn, parasitic terrors with no desire but to infest other living creatures and, through their deaths, spread ever more of their terrible kind. A typical spawning canker stands as tall as the humanoid body it infests, plus 2 to 3 feet of added height from its dozen or so wild tendrils. Slugspawn (CR 5) Bloated alien worms the length of a man\\'s forearm, slugspawn are the basest form of a moit of Shub-Niggurath. These repulsive creatures possess sluglike bodies the color of rotting algae, covered with thick mucus. Vulnerable to the predations of larger creatures, slugspawn rarely venture forth on their own. Although they can move at a speed of 10 feet per round, slugspawn frequently hide themselves in dark pools or shadowy crevices, waiting for the warm flesh and pliant brains they crave to come to them. Upon entering a square with a slugspawn in it (or if attacked by a slugspawn), a creature must make a DC 16 Perception check to note that a slugspawn is something other than a normal slug (though hidden slugspawn can be more difficult to detect). If this Perception check is failed, the slugspawn leaps upon the creature and burrows into its flesh. The creature can attempt a DC 16 Reflex save to avoid the slugspawn, but only if the creature is aware of the slugspawn\\'s presence. Any amount of damage reduction is enough to provide immunity to infestation. Once a slugspawn has infested a living body, it burrows toward the host\\'s skull and wraps around the lower brain, growing and feeding upon the energies generated by thought. On the first round of infestation, dealing cold damage to the victim can kill the slugspawn and save the host-but only if the victim takes 10 or more points within 1 round of being infested. Cutting the slugspawn out also works, but the longer it remains in a host, the more damage this method does. Cutting it out requires a slashing weapon and a DC 25 Heal check, and deals 1d6 points of damage per round that the host has been infested. If the Heal check is successful, the slugspawn is removed. After 3 rounds, though, the slugspawn has reached the host\\'s brain and cannot be surgically removed without killing the host. Remove disease kills any slugspawn in or on a host. After a slugspawn has reached a host\\'s brain, it proves to be a beneficial parasite-at least initially. A slugspawn\\'s host benefits from complete immunity to mind-affecting effects, as the slugspawn\\'s presence confuses and devours such magic. This benefit doesn\\'t last for long, though, as after a variable period (typically lasting 2d6 days in humanoids, though sometimes more or less in other creature types) the slugspawn matures into a spawning canker, a new stage in its lifecycle that begins with it violently devouring its host\\'s brain, erupting from its skull, and taking over the beheaded host body-a near instantaneous process that immediately kills the host. The result is a new creature, a spawning canker garbed in its former host\\'s skin. If the host is killed before the slugspawn fully matures, the parasite undergoes a rapid, emergency maturation, taking control of the host body as if it had fully matured-though such spawning cankers rarely prove as long-lived as their fully matured brethren. Reproductive Rampage Moits of Shub-Niggurath, in both their spawning canker and slugspawn forms, exist for a single reason: to propagate their fouls species as their unknowable brood mother desires. Theirs are not the ways of obsessed cultists or otherworldly masterminds. Rather, they are akin to living diseases, massive viruses that infiltrate, infest, and overwhelm, desiring nothing more than to spread their kind and pave the way for a new, larger generation that might spawn in the name of the Goat with a Thousand Young, their very existence being an unholy prayer to her power. Moits lack agendas beyond spawning. In their alien philosophies, infesting a victim, growing into a canker, and then \"ascending\" is the ultimate glory. While slugspawn have only an instinctual impression of their role in the greater cycle, spawning cankers are true fanatics, obsessed with propagation. While they avoid competing with others of their kind, if resources are limited, each canker seeks to assure that it can spawn. The moits have no interest in rationing humanoid hosts to assure their allies or spawn have the means to reproduce. Instead, they care only for the moment and the immediate potential to spawn. Thus, whole regions might be wiped clean by the infectious invasion of these moits, which grow all the more desperate as hosts and, by extension, opportunities to fulfill their lives\\' only purpose diminish.'},\n",

This fact owes more to the rarity of interactions between nightshades and fiends in general-despite nightshades' own fiendish origins-as they are relatively isolated from the Abyss and Abbadon, and prey on those planes' residents as willingly as on those of the Material Plane.\"},\n",

       "   'description': \"Dark princes and warlords of old, wight lords are undead monarchs. Where typical wights rise from a wide variety of individuals, wight lords rise from the bodies of despotic rulers or ruthless generals. Wight lords haunt the same ancient burial grounds and battlefields their lesser kin dwell in, but wight lords aren't satisfied by simply guarding their haunts against the living. They continue their reign as tyrants in death, ruling over undead armies and often compelling their unliving minions to wage war upon nearby towns or cities, sometimes even at the behest of bold and powerful necromancers. The statistics that are presented above represent the minimum power level of a wight lord. A wight lord can rise from the remains of any cruel or sadistic leader, but those who were higher than 11th level when they perished retain some of their previous life's knowledge-although not all of it. When this occurs, subtract 11 from the creature's previous number of class levels to determine the total number of class levels the wight lord possesses. Assign these class levels to the wight lord in a logical way-if it was a single-classed NPC in life, simply add more levels of that class to the wight lord. Multiclassed characters and those who possessed levels in prestige classes require more creativity in applying the class levels. The goal for building such a wight lord should be to approximate the themes and general abilities the creature had in life.\"},\n",

       "   'description': \"The Mother's Maw is the herald of Urgathoa. A disgusting undead creature that comes to the mortal realm at the command of the Pallid Princess, it is an unsubtle thing of ravenous hunger, with little purpose but to kill, eat, and animate corpses as undead. Though it is as brilliant as a lich, its only interests are in satisfy its cravings for sensation. The Maw has little interest in the desires of mortals (or of undead in the mortal world) except for how they intersect with Urgathoa's orders. If it is necessary to eat a hundred members of her cult, or to drive an entire city of ghouls into a lava pit, the Maw does it. It can speak but finds little worth talking about, so many assume it is as mindless as an animated skeleton. However, when not on a mission of death, disease, or gluttony, it is a font of knowledge about food, wine, exotic scents, and other strange experiences only an undead creature can understand, and is quite willing to speak on these matters to an interested party-assuming the sight of the enormous talking, winged skull isn't a distraction to listeners. Although the Maw normally appears as a bare skull, it sometimes covers itself with its swarms. Whether this is out of a morbid sense of humor or an attempt to remember an old sensation from its life is unknown. It has confirmed that it was once a devourer, and before that a living creature, but it does not give further details Ecology The Mother's Maw is an immortal undead, able to recover from almost any attack and lacking the need to eat or drink. However, it still enjoys these things and is driven by a desire to experience sensation like the worst mortal hedonist. It has been known to eat and spit out entire herds of cattle (one steer at a time), to crash into winery casks to soak itself for hours in fine and mediocre vintages alike, to roll in exotic spices, or to wrap itself in fine cloth until it looks like a giant mummy skull. Worshipers of the Pallid Princess who wish to curry the herald's favor know to have large amounts of food, drink, or other luxuries for it to experience, consume, or defile. Sometimes the goddess commands the Maw to be quiet, and it finds a resting place such as a large temple where it can wait for days or weeks, using only its power to animate the dead to create servants for the faithful, or in an old battlefield or graveyard, casually creating dozens of undead that lurk about it like cultists around a gross idol. When the Herald leaves, the undead are left behind, either for the worshipers to maintain or turned loose to attack the living. It has no respect for life, and if left to its own devices, it casually kills things as a distraction, often reanimating them and killing them again. Habitat & Society Because of its innate ability to create undead, the herald is sometimes accompanied by skeletons, zombies, and ghouls, which caper about it, endlessly adoring the emissary of the goddess of undeath. It has been known to ferry allies into battle, or (rarely) to rescue a powerful undead creature, spiriting its passenger away to safety within its bony gullet, relying on its own defenses to keep its passenger safe. It is particularly fond of raveners and vampires, and has gone out of its way to aid them when given the choice of several allies.\"},\n",

       "   'description': 'A wax golem is an exact replica of a particular person, composed completely of wax. While skilled artists pride themselves on their ability to make wax sculptures look lifelike, builders of wax golems go one step further and actually bring their art to life. Though eerily silent and unblinking, well-built wax golems bear such striking similarity to the subjects they are modeled after that some golems begin to think they are in fact that person. A wax golem can be constructed to resemble any person or creature, though they typically look like human subjects, standing at the same height and weighing about three times as much. Ecology Wax golems are often constructed by artistic spell-casters who fancy making their work a little more authentic-looking. Though these golems can look like anything from faceless, colorless drones to finely detailed reconstructions, they all share the commonality of being formed purely from hard wax. Most wax golem crafters choose to create these lifelike statues not for aesthetic purposes, however, but to undertake devious chores such as infiltration, espionage, or assassination. Habitat & Society Wax golems possess the mysterious ability of possibly gaining self-awareness, an attribute almost exclusively reserved for humanoid creatures born of natural means. By resembling a subject so greatly, wax golems have a small chance of gaining conscious thought and higher-level thinking, effectively manifesting their own sentience. This extraordinary ability has no logical explanation, though some constructors of these beings who have witnessed this transformation theorize that wax golems obtain self-awareness by watching humanoids over an extended period of time. Wax golems that spend a significant amount of time around people who mistake them for the subjects they resemble (such as golems sent to perform espionage) have an even greater chance of gaining sentience. Oddly, wax golems that gain sentience also develop the genuine belief that they are who they are modeled after. This notion is so strong that if such a wax golem were to encounter the individual it is modeled after, it would go to great lengths to exterminate the person and take his or her place in society, even adopting a code of morals and principles similar to those of the murdered subject. In this way, wax golems stealthily inject themselves into roles as diplomats, leaders, and authority figures, often to the detriment of people close to the usurped individual. So meticulously designed are wax golems, however, that few can identify a wax golem as a fraud, even when in close proximity. Along with sentience, wax golems achieve moderate intelligence, as well as the ability to communicate and speak. In order to mask the glossy sheen associated with their wax bodies, deceptive golems take special care to garb themselves in clothes that hide their peculiar complexions. They still do not eat, sleep, or breathe, but crafty golems easily avoid the complications associated with these trivialities. The only definitive clue a well-built wax golem cannot easily hide is the distinct texture of its skin, which, even to the most unobservant individual, does not feel anything like flesh. Because of this, wax golems tend to be aloof and secretive, never allowing any one person to get too close, a trait that does not go unnoticed by those well-acquainted with the original individual, who tend to pick up on the rather sudden shift in demeanor. Environmental hazards such as heat from the sun or cold precipitation have little effect on wax golems, though constant exposure to temperatures over 100 degrees for more than an hour does produce a rather odd sheen, and spending longer than a day in such weather begins to take its toll on the golem, dealing 1d4 points of fire damage every hour spent in the elements after the first. Construction The construction of a wax golem requires a block of solid wax the size of whatever individual it is to be molded after, typically weighing over 1,000 pounds. The wax is treated with dyes and magical unguents worth at least 500 gp. The simplest wax golems require the creator to make a Craft (sculptures) check, with wax golems resembling specific races or individuals requiring higher DCs. While wax golems that look like living creatures possess greater versatility, they also have the potential of gaining a strange sort of sentience. Wax Golem CL 9th; Price 14,000 gp Construction Requirements Craft Construct, animate objects, geas/quest, limited wish, silent image, creator must be caster level 9th; Skill Craft (sculptures) DC 18 (DC 25 if the creator wants the golem to look like a member of a particular race; DC 30 if the creator wants the golem to look like a specific individual); Cost 7,000 gp'},\n",

Mute hags exist to unmake happy things. Tales claim the natural order despises the crones so much that plants wither at their touch, storms churn at their passing, and wounds they inflict never heal. Though physically capable of ripping a man in two, the crones prefer to corrupt instead. They move silently through peaceful settlements, granting the inhabitants' darkest desires and sowing the seeds of discord. Nothing pleases a mute hag more than watching friends, neighbors, and lovers murder one another in paranoia and rage. Many strike unholy bargains with mortal outcasts, granting vigor, beauty, or revenge in exchange for vile and unforgivable crimes. Mute hags resemble mortal women, but with blotchy, bruised-looking skin. Some conceal their empty eye sockets and ragged teeth with veils or their own hair, but most relish their hideous countenances. Mute hags stand 6 to 7 feet tall and weigh 150 to 250 pounds.\"},\n",

       "   'description': 'The means of attaining lichdom are extremely personal for mortal spellcasters, fraught with misinformation and peril. The smallest miscalculation in the potion of lichdom\\'s formula or most minute flaw in one\\'s phylactery can interrupt the process that infuses one\\'s mortal soul with overwhelming arcane and negative energies. Other times, an inexperienced wizard attempts the transformation, or erroneously consumes a formula produced for another spellcaster, instantly dying from the backlash of potent forces or condemning himself to a terminal but far more terrible end. In these sorrowful cases, the process traps the soul of the would-be lich outside a phylactery that will not accept it and a body that has rejected it. The potent arcane forces tampered with by the lich\\'s failed creation also find themselves unleashed but uncontrolled, surrounding the newly formed abomination, empowering it but also slowly consuming its essence. This creature, known as a forsaken lich, is granted the undeath it sought in life, but in a terrifyingly temporary fashion. For the miscalculations of its ambitions, the creature\\'s once-vibrant body shrivels and decays like that of a lich, but becomes a lifeless shell manipulated by the malicious soul and unchecked magical storm that envelop it, forces that control the corpse\\'s actions almost like a marionette. Yet this doom is temporary for nearly all who attempt this foul transition. With the soul unbound from the body and both spirit and corpse exposed to destructive arcane tides, both are slowly eroded. After 1d10 days, the forsaken lich\\'s body and soul are both consumed like a lit candle, eventually reduced physically to ashes, and spiritually to nothing-its essence utterly annihilated, scoured from existence for all time. Creating a Forsaken Lich \"Forsaken lich\" is an acquired template that can be added to any living creature (referred to hereafter as the base creature), provided it can create the required phylactery. Rarely, a creature unable to create a phylactery stumbles upon this state through tragic ambition. A forsaken lich retains all the base creature\\'s statistics and special abilities except as noted here. CR: Same as the base creature +2. Alignment: Any evil. Type: The creature\\'s type changes to undead. Do not recalculate BAB, saves, or skill ranks. Senses: A forsaken lich gains darkvision 60 ft. Armor Class: A forsaken lich has a +3 natural armor bonus or the base creature\\'s natural armor bonus, whichever is better. Hit Dice: Change all of the creature\\'s racial Hit Dice to d8s. All Hit Dice derived from class levels remain unchanged. As undead, forsaken liches use their Charisma modifiers to determine bonus hit points (instead of Constitution). Defensive Abilities: A forsaken lich gains channel resistance +4, DR 15/bludgeoning and magic, spell resistance 25, and immunity to cold and electricity, in addition to immunities granted by its undead traits. The forsaken lich also gains the following defensive abilities. Soul Shield (Su): The shadowy double superimposed over the forsaken lich\\'s corporeal form flits around its body, granting the creature concealment (20% miss chance). The miss chance increases to 50% in dim light. This ability never grants total concealment; it only increases miss chances. Spell Storm (Su): A forsaken lich is the epicenter of a squall of unchecked magical energies. If a spell targets the forsaken lich and fails to overcome its spell resistance, this uncontrolled magic redirects the spell as per spell turning. The forsaken lich is always considered to have 10 spell levels of turning left for the purposes of this effect, even if it is affected by multiple spells in the same round. Special Attacks: A forsaken lich gains the special attack described below. Save DCs are equal to 10 +1/2 the forsaken lich\\'s HD +the forsaken lich\\'s Charisma modifier unless otherwise noted. Disembodied Strike (Su): The forsaken lich has a special touch attack that it can make as a standard action, using its highest base attack bonus. This attack originates when its disembodied soul reaches out independently and uses negative energy to deal 1d8 points of damage to living creatures +1 point of damage per every 2 Hit Dice possessed by the forsaken lich. This attack has a reach 5 feet greater than the forsaken lich\\'s normal reach, and may be directed at nearby undead creatures to heal them, or used on the forsaken lich itself to heal damage inf licted on its corporeal form. Soul Lash (Su): Unbridled magic endlessly funnels into a forsaken lich\\'s body, scouring its body and soul with mighty energies. As a swift action, each round a forsaken lich can unleash this dark energy in a blast of pure magical destructiveness. This blast takes the form of a 240-foot line of destructive energy that deals an amount of damage equal to 1d6 per 2 Hit Dice the forsaken lich possesses (to a maximum of 20d6) and paralyzes those affected for 1d10 rounds. Creatures that make a Ref lex save partially avoid the arcane lash, taking only half damage and avoiding the paralysis. This energy is not completely under the forsaken lich\\'s control. If the forsaken lich does not spend a swift action to discharge the energy every round, it takes an amount of damage equal to 1d6 x 1/4 of its total Hit Dice. Special Qualities: A forsaken lich gains the following special quality. Delusory Aura (Su): Like its soul, a forsaken lich\\'s mind is discorporated and scattered across the area around its corpse. This fills the area within 100 feet of the forsaken lich with an ever-shifting panoply of its darkest dreams, dashed ambitions, and enraged insanity. This area is considered to be under the effects of mirage arcana, but of a particularly disturbing variety. All living creatures within the area take a -4 penalty on any saves against fear effects. If the effect is dispelled, it reconstitutes 1 round later. Abilities: Str +6, Cha +6. Being undead, a lich has no Constitution score.'},\n",

Many magic-users also create constructs in the shapes and forms of gargoyles, emulating those creatures' ability to blend in with stone structures and taking advantage of the pervasiveness of sculpted gargoyles to create stealthy protectors and watchdogs. Many spellcasters construct gargoyle guardians that have special abilities, making them even more capable and vigilant sentinels. Gargoyle Sentry (+0 CR): These gargoyle guardians are created with eyes of citrine linked to a 1-foot-diameter orb of the same stone. The orb always displays what the gargoyle guardian sees, though without the construct's darkvision or low-light vision. If the gargoyle sentry is destroyed, its eyes and the linked orb shatter into worthless dust. Construction A gargoyle guardian's body is made from 1,000 pounds of dense stone-typically of the colors and designs of the structure or memorial it is meant to guard-and treated with 1,000 gp worth of rare minerals and precious filigree.

While their diminutive brethren measure several inches long, the monstrous variety measure 10 feet long and weigh up to 800 pounds. The body of the giant hellgrammite is long and flattened, and generally ranges from dark brown to reddish in color. The front third of its body consists of a well-armored head and thoracic segments, with stout, segmented legs. The head possesses a fearsome set of jaws, small antennae, and a set of clustered eye spots on either side. The posterior twothirds of the hellgrammite consist of nine densely haired abdominal segments, each with a pair of lateral filaments and gill tufts underneath for underwater breathing. The hellgrammite's abdomen ends in pair of terminal prolegs, each with a pair of hooks, which aid the creature in climbing or anchoring itself in fast-moving currents, and can be used in a tail slap to slash at its enemies. The giant hellgrammite is a simple but ferocious predator. It latches onto its prey with its deadly jaws and proceeds to crush the life from it, feeding on the body after its victim can no longer struggle. The hellgrammite often attempts to drag the prey back to a protected area between or behind stream boulders, or down to the bottom of a deep side-pool. The strength of a hellgrammite's jaws is so great that, even in death, they clench tightly and do not relinquish their grip.\"},\n",

       "   'description': 'Hala demons are commonly known as storm demons. Bound to service by Pazuzu, these demons ride the winds across the Abyssal skies, lurk within dark and turbulent clouds, and act as his scouts and spies. Halas have a single, blood-red eye, an enormous mouth lined with razor-sharp teeth, and lengthy horns growing from their heads. A typical hala stands 7 feet tall, weighs 200 pounds, and possesses large wings that span 20 feet across. Ecology Hala demons form from covetous souls, those who desired the possessions of others so much so that they indulged in such acts as murder, theft, or blackmail. The more persons harmed by these desires, the more likely the soul is to become a hala in the Abyss. Halas are masters of the winds, harnessing the power of storms, redirecting and amplifying that energy to cause the most damage and chaos possible. They relish the destructive forces of their storms, and can manipulate a storm\\'s energy to rain down hailstones to pelt the area. Their command of the winds also aids them in flight. They are never impeded by storm winds, but instead ride them, often achieving top speeds by accelerating the wind currents around them. Due to the nature of their origin, halas are highly possessive. A hala will often refer to the storm clouds they marshal as \"my storm.\" A hala is predisposed to grab any item it finds particularly desirable, and will actively pillage regions that its storm passes over. The desire to take from others remains so prevalent in the hala\\'s nature that it often carries large sacks in which to place all the items it takes during its flights. Bags of holding or handy haversacks are highly prized possessions to a hala, as it allows it to pillage even more items. Halas are voracious, with large mouths that open nearly ear-to-ear. Edible items they find in their pillaging are often consumed immediately. This includes a particular appetite for children and other Small humanoids. Habitat & Society Halas can be seen throughout the Abyss, roaming the skies in servitude to Pazuzu as his dedicated scout force. Their heaviest concentration, however, exists in High M\\'Vania, as all hala demons are required to return to Pazuzu\\'s realm once a century to report all that they have observed. Despite the duty to return to High M\\'Vania, halas are solitary demons, distrusting all others, especially other hala demons, fearing that they will attempt to take their pillaged possessions. Therefore, most halas live in isolated, remote areas where they maintain their hoards of ill-gotten gains. Pazuzu values his hala minions not only for the intelligence they gather on the activities of his enemies in the Abyss, but also for the chaos and destruction they bring on the winds. He is especially fond of sending halas to the Material Plane to ravage the countryside with storms and hail. As in the Abyss, halas on the Material Plane prefer to reside in remote areas. The lair of a hala is often located in a hidden cave in an isolated mountain range, or in the hollow of a giant, ancient tree deep in a forest or swamp. While hala demons have a general dislike for or distrust of nearly all creatures, they have an especially strong fear and hatred of two creatures: eagles and dragons. Eagles have an innate response to attack and drive a hala from the skies, possibly due to the threat the hala represents to the eagle\\'s territory and offspring. Dragons-of any breed-largely view the storm demons as a danger to their own hoards of treasure, for if a hala discovers the dragon\\'s lair, it will stop at nothing to possess all that lies within it.'},\n",

       "   'description': \"Yamabushi tengus are oni with a predilection toward thievery and trickery, wearing the flesh of wicked, fiendish tengus. When a yamabushi tengu first appears, its first course of action is invariably to seek out a well-hidden nest or other nook to serve as a lair. Despite their ability to fly, most yamabushi tengus are nervous in open areas, since it's easy to be seen in such environs. A yamabushi tengu is more at home indoors or at night, where it can skulk in the shadows when it's unsure of its surroundings. A yamabushi tengu is 5 feet tall and weighs 120 pounds. Ecology While most yamabushi tengus look like normal tengus, they can actually manifest in a number of humanoid bird shapes. Ravens and crows are the most common model which these creatures take their appearance from, yet tales exist of yamabushi tengus with features more akin to cranes, eagles, peacocks, gulls, vultures, and even pelicans. Only the features of ducks and other billed avians (like geese) are notably absent from yamabushi tengus. In fact, yamabushi tengus have a strange loathing for ducks-they find these birds to be a mix of comic tragedy and pitiful hideousness, from the blunt shape of their bills to their distinctive gait and their warbling quacks. The presence of a duck can often provoke even the most restrained and crafty yamabushi tengu into making poor choices: faced with choosing between attacking a truly dangerous foe or using their weapons and magic against a nearby duck, most yamabushi tengus make the choice to kill the duck, even if such an act might compromise their position to their actual enemy. Habitat & Society Yamabushi tengus are driven by greed, particularly for shiny treasures like coins, jewels, gems, and polished weapons. Many extend this obsession to clothing (favoring brightly colored silks) and armor (preferring light armor over medium or heavy armor). Most of what a yamabushi tengu plots or plans can be traced to a desire to gather as much shiny treasure as possible, but they are also especially entranced and intrigued by avian humanoids-particularly tengus, dire corbies (see Pathfinder Campaign Setting: Misfit Monsters Redeemed) and garudas (see Pathfinder Module: Cult of the Ebon Destroyers). Yamabushi tengus share the most in common with tengus, of course, for it is from these creatures that the oni take their forms. Dire corbies and garudas, being non-humanoid monsters (monstrous humanoids and outsiders respectively) are in strange ways both similar and quite different from tengus, and as such yamabushi tengus find them endlessly fascinating. In the case of dire corbies, the creatures' feral natures, xenophobic personalities, and overall lack of civilization make them ideal groups for a yamabushi tengu to infiltrate and take control of-although in most cases, a yamabushi tengu who infiltrates a dire corby flock eventually grows tired of the crude creatures and moves on. Garudas are more difficult for yamabushi tengus to interact with, for these outsiders are generally good. Encounters between garudas and yamabushi tengus almost always end in combat, typically with the more powerful garuda the victor. As a result, when confronted by a garuda, most yamabushi tengus choose subtlety over direct confrontation. In a best-case scenario, a yamabushi tengu's minions or allies capture and restrain the garuda, giving the yamabushi tengu ample opportunity to interrogate or even vivisect the garuda prisoner. Most yamabushi tengus, though, find greatest comfort dwelling among thieves' guilds-particularly among those populated by tengus, in which case a yamabushi tengu appears in its natural form, using its wings as an obvious badge of superiority over its flightless tengu kin. Among thieves of other races (such as humans), a yamabushi tengu prefers to stay in its humanoid form. However, when a yamabushi tengu assumes the form of anything other than a tengu, its true nature is difficult for it to hide, for invariably the shapechanged oni's nose remains quite prodigious, usually to an almost comical degree. Strangely enough, however, yamabushi tengus generally don't think of their unusual noses as flaws in their magical disguises. A yamabushi tengu can also retain its wings when using its change shape ability, and these pinions, as well as its beaklike nose, are a sure way to tell a disguised yamabushi tengu apart from others.\"},\n",

       "   'description': 'So named for a northern word for \"river,\" a gare linnorm\\'s body resembles that of a gigantic serpent, save for two muscular forelimbs. The creature\\'s head is long and angular, with crests that it uses to break through ice in its never-ending search for food. A gare linnorm\\'s hide is a dull gray color akin to tarnished silver, with a slightly paler underbelly. Unlike many linnorms, a gare linnorm has a smooth hide, allowing it to slip easily through water and ice holes. A gare linnorm can grow as long as 60 feet, typically weighs 11,000 pounds, and can live for over 1,000 years. Ecology Little can compare to the power and efficiency of a gare linnorm in the regions where these beasts dwell. Like all linnorms, gare linnorms are relatively unintelligent compared with their chromatic and metallic cousins, but what these beasts lack in intelligence and spellcasting ability they make up for in brute strength, savage fury, and dangerous cunning. Despite dwelling in water, gare linnorms have an innate ability to raise their body temperature so dramatically that the creatures are immune to even the hottest flames. Gare linnorms use this ability to keep warm when hunting through rivers and waterways buried beneath feet of ice, which the creature can come bursting through with surprising speed and force when it detects prey above. A gare linnorm\\'s breath weapon is similarly linked to this internal fire. Small gill-like vents along the creature\\'s serpentine body pass water through the dragon, which is heated to extreme temperatures en route to the linnorm\\'s mouth. The gare linnorm then expels the water through a series of muscular chambers that turn the water into a gout of steam hot enough to scald flesh and warp armor. The difference in temperature between the inside of the linnorm\\'s mouth and the cold air of its homelands causes the steam to condense into a massive cloud of vapor that persists afterward and, because of the linnorm\\'s magical nature, achieves an almost solid state, hampering movement throughout its area. In addition to its deadly breath weapon, a gare linnorm\\'s fangs are infused with potent venom. A creature bitten by the dragon is bathed in an eerie blue-white aura that burns like the hottest alchemist\\'s fire. Meanwhile the poison attacks the nervous system with debilitating pain, gradually slowing the target\\'s ref lexes and motor functions until total paralysis sets in. Gare linnorms prefer to hunt large prey, as fish and other small underwater creatures don\\'t provide enough food to sate their enormous appetites. As a result, gare linnorms hunt not just larger, land-bound creatures like elk or moose, but even large predatory animals like brown bears and dire wolves when such creatures come to the water\\'s edge to drink or cross. When hunting, a gare linnorm attempt to attack with surprise as it breaks through ice or emerges from the water. It bites first to poison its prey, then strikes with its tail, using its massive coils to crush its prey or drag it into the water, where any creature affected by the linnorm\\'s poison soon drowns as the venom takes hold. Hunters and sages who have witnessed gare linnorms feeding recount stories of these monsters taking on entire herds of mammoths or woolly rhinos, often crushing one animal in its coils and goring another while others burn within the dragon\\'s steaming breath. After feeding, gare linnorms retreat to their riverbed dens to sleep, often for days at a time. Habitat & Society Gare linnorms are always solitary. Their immense appetites and brutal tempers make most habitats strain to support even one, and a gare linnorm\\'s territory can encompass a labyrinth of rivers and inlets exceeding 1,000 square miles. Males and females do not even join for reproduction. Instead, after a short period of voracious hunting and gorging, a female gare linnorm travels to the fringes of her territory to find a deeply frozen lake or section of river. The female then uses her breath weapon to melt a portion of the ice before laying a single egg and letting it float to the underside of the ice, still far beneath the surface. Next, the female stands guard until the water refreezes, encasing and protecting her egg, before returning to the heart of her territory. Any passing male can sense the egg, even within its icy shell, and uses his breath to free and fertilize it, after which he carries the fertilized egg beyond his own territory and deposits it deep in the mud and silt of a riverbed. The egg gestates for 6 months before hatching. A hatchling gare linnorm is the size of an adult crocodile and survives on fish and birds for the first few months. Growth is rapid, with the linnorm reaching half its adult length within 2 years, when it begins to hunt larger land creatures, its breath weapon and venom now at full potency. Reproductive maturity is achieved after the first century, with females producing an egg just once every century. Despite their fearsome reputations, gare linnorms are sometimes hunted by the brave or the foolhardy. In the Lands of the Linnorm Kings, would-be kings who kill a gare linnorm are afforded extra prestige, as such combat often requires fighting the beast both on land and on or beneath the surface of the water. Frost giants are also known to hunt gare linnorms, but invariably target hatchlings or the very young, raising the captive dragons as powerful sentries and loyal companions that are often more dangerous than the giant\\'s entire clan.'},\n",

       "   'description': \"Nogitsune are created when oni spirits take over the bodies of kitsune (sagacious humanoid fox-creatures). The resultant possession creates a creature with the kitsune's foxlike grace and cunning and infuses it with the destructive power of an oni. Nogitsune are always female, and resemble shapely humans with a covering of fur and a fox's head. A nogitsune's fur color varies and can be orange and white, grey, pure white, or even black. Whenever nogitsune use their shapechanging abilities to assume a humanoid form, they still evince somewhat pointed, vulpine features. In addition, any hair on their assumed form betrays the natural coloration of their pelts. Nogitsune stand between 5 and 5-1/2 feet tall and weigh just over 100 pounds. More details on kitsune can be found in Pathfinder Campaign Setting: Dragon Empires Gazetteer. Ecology Oni manifest themselves in different ways based on the creatures they take as vessels for their depraved wrath. They take particular joy in corrupting kitsune to form nogitsune, delighting in turning the mystical creatures into deadly killers and spreaders of woe. Most nogitsune become spies or assassins. Though they need no real reason to kill others, the coin they receive for their services allows them to afford the other vices they enjoy, such as pleasures of the flesh and excesses of drink and narcotics (when available). Nogitsune are deft killers because of their speed, grace, and spell-like abilities. Those who have seen them and lived tell tales of these oni running toward walls at blinding speed and then simply continuing upward to vault the wall's crown as if it were no more difficult to walk on than the ground. Still others claim that nogitsune can dive into a shadow like a pool of water and disappear, while others mention the cloud of smoke that nogitsune often use to escape pursuit, even when running full speed. Although they often don human form to disguise themselves for the purpose of inf iltration, nogitsune prefer to stalk and kill prey in their natural form. This gives the creatures the choice of whether to use manufactured weapons or their own sharp claws and deadly bite. When wielding weapons, all nogitsune enjoy using poison, whenever possible employing toxins and venoms that do not kill outright (unless a contract so requires it) but rather render the victims unconscious or helpless. This gives the oni the joy of dealing the killing blow with their jaws and slaking their bloodlust in abject savagery. A nogitsune's most feared weapon, however, is its contagious whisper. This powerful compulsion, often whispered into the victim's ear in honeyed tones, not only forces the targeted creature to believe whatever lie the nogitsune crafts, but also infects the subject of the contagious whisper with a corruptive echo of deceit that causes the victim to unknowingly pass on the nogitsune's suggestion to others. Nogitsune may use this ability to convince a successive series of servants to open all of the doors to a well-guarded castle, or to make a host of witnesses believe they saw an innocent man commit a brutal crime that was really the oni's own handiwork. Habitat & Society Nogitsune inhabit large urban areas, where they can have their pick of a nearly endless stream of victims. Occasionally they will inhabit a town or village in the countryside, but such locales are always in the shadow of a large castle or estate that can provide additional opportunities to stalk and murder others. Wherever they choose to dwell, nogitsune lair in the seediest districts, where drugs, brothels, and crime are rampant. These areas not only discourage chase by would-be pursuers, but also place the oni in the midst of people who society generally doesn't miss if and when a contract doesn't slake the creature's bloodlust. Those looking to hire a nogitsune can do so, but such a practice is both costly and dangerous. Although little binds a nogitsune to its accepted contract when it receives payment, most nogitsune happily carry out their orders for the sheer joy of bringing death to another. But many who foolishly hire nogitsune to do their killing find themselves the next victim once the initial target is slain. Nogitsune have little honor, and such treachery not only feeds their bloodlust, but also leaves fewer witnesses. Nogitsune prefer to lead solitary lives and be in command of their own foul fates. Thus, most avoid associating with more powerful creatures, other oni, or even other nogitsune. Those honorable samurai and good ninja who have fought and killed nogitsune recount seeing a conf licted and turbulent anger within the creatures, as if the once-righteous kitsune within a nogitsune constantly battles to reassert control. Although there is no record of such a reversal occurring, many believe that these malevolent oni drown themselves in death and bloodshed in order to extinguish the last vestiges of the creatures they were before.\"},\n",

       "   'description': \"The Spirit of Adoration is among Shelyn's greatest servants, an intelligent personification of true love, whose power lifts the heaviest heart and overcomes all obstacles. She rarely comes to the mortal world, and it is even rarer for her to enter battle, but when that time comes, it is said that there is nothing she cannot bend or break in pursuit of her goal. The spirit's true form is that of a 10-foot-tall, angel-winged woman-usually a human but sometimes an elf-dressed in flowing clothes and bearing a shining steel glaive. When interacting with easily frightened mortals (especially children), she uses her shapechanging powers to look like a human or elf of normal height, attractive according to the standards of the local people, but she never makes herself so beautiful as to cause jealousy or inspire inappropriate comments or attention. When not carrying out Shelyn's will, the spirit enjoys dancing in clouds, across lakes, and on mountaintops, whether on Golarion or Nirvana, ignoring the occasional bolt of lightning that strikes her. Ecology Although she does not need to eat, the spirit loves the occasional taste of food or wine, especially wedding cake and champagne toasts. While she does not need to sleep, she loves to dream, deciding the framework of her dreams before she sleeps and enjoying the mystery of how they play out. Sleeping is the only time she is still, as she loves motion, frequently dancing with joy or gesturing with her hands while speaking. Her primary role is as a messenger of love and beauty, encouraging mortals to pursue love and create art, and for much of her work she is present but invisible, speaking just the right words to accomplish her mission and vanishing thereafter. The spirit only kills when she absolutely has to, such as when confronted by mindless creatures or irredeemable undead, and even then only if sparing them would create a threat to others. She prefers to let her aura of charming change hostile creatures into temporary allies, giving her time to move aggressive opponents away from innocents and speak words of diplomacy under more amiable conditions. She uses her stunning bolts against creatures she believes can be talked into surrender or peace, reserving her glaive and attack spells for recalcitrant foes and alien or mindless things that absolutely cannot understand love or beauty. Habitat & Society The spirit is a creature of love and is open with her emotions to all mortals. She treasures the presence of every infant, child, adult, and animal, and can appreciate the beauty of any landscape, no matter how stark, blasted, or strange. She is generous, compassionate, and tolerant, and those who meet her under pleasant circumstances can't help but agree that she is one of the nicest creatures they've ever met. However, most of her interactions on the mortal world occur when some great love or beautiful work of art is threatened. At these times she grows quiet, her eyes burn with the fire of true love threatened, and her face becomes the stern mask of an artist lost in the moment of finishing her masterpiece. When inspired by this cause, her hands wield glaive, spell, and ray in a beautiful and enthralling dance, as though they move to the very music of creation. The spirit has an excellent memory for names and faces, and enjoys tracing the family trees of Shelyn's agathion servitors, often recognizing a distant mortal relation 10 generations later. She is friends with all of the goddess's minions, and shares this affection with their mortal relatives. Though she is not a gossip, she listens to her fellow celestials and is aware of who they've helped in the mortal world; she keeps tabs on those who have benefited from the goddess's favor in the past and, if necessary, might be willing to repay a past favor. The minions of Zon-Kuthon fill her with pity. Whenever she encounters them, she tries to steal them away to a temple of her creator and have the priests try to cleanse the mental stains of that dark god. She tries this with his divine servants as well, with much more limited success.\"},\n",

To the faithful of Ghlaunder, being host to an immature blightspawn is a great honor, for when the monster bursts from the body of its host, the host's consciousness lives on in some way in the blightspawn's mind, almost as if the host had reincarnated into the monster. That cultists who die giving hideous birth to a blightspawn cannot be resurrected lends a bit of weight to this notion, even if the blightspawn themselves have nothing to say on the topic. A cultist carrying an immature blightspawn functions normally in all ways until the creature emerges (typically upon the cultist's death, or at the culmination of certain vile rituals)-except that until then, the cultist can pass on new blightspawn to his or her children. A blightspawn's gestation can last for decades, and in cases in which a child is separated from infected parents, the child might live her entire life without knowing the truth of what awaits her upon death. When a blightspawn emerges from its host, it is immediately fully grown, although its gore-wet wings cannot be used for flight for 1d4 rounds after emerging.\"},\n",

       "   'description': 'The people of Kalva are a brutal and merciless tribe of cannibalistic barbarians. While they are most often encountered on their desolate, dreary isle, their hunger sometimes drives them to nearby shorelines. That the Kalvamen are poor shipbuilders and even worse at navigation is a blessing, for it keeps them from being a greater danger than they already are. Nevertheless, enough of them make it to the mainland to cause problems, and the fact that they often wreck their ships in the process and thus become stranded makes them even more dangerous. Often known as berserker cannibals, these degenerates delight in stalking, ambushing, and devouring foreign humanoids. Well practiced at hunting in Kalva\\'s forbidding terrain, berserker cannibals prefer to silently creep up on a victim before launching forward with gargling shrieks. Eager to dismember prey with their greataxes in a bloody frenzy, these berserkers tend to only use their javelins against flying creatures, or those that can outrun them. Those unfortunate enough to survive the initial attack, or who make the poor choice to surrender to the berserkers, face a horrific fate. The berserkers drag living bounty back to their camps or caves, where they keep their prisoners \"fresh\" as long as possible by amputating and consuming their limbs one at a time. Each tribe has a few members capable of forging high-quality weapons and armor. Iron and steel aren\\'t common on the isle of Kalva, and when the metals do appear in their societies, shamans are quick to use them to forge magical greataxes for the berserkers. While the berserkers spend much of their time roaming the island\\'s interior on the hunt for sentient creatures, they also take time to plant and harvest hidden fields of crops in the island\\'s rich volcanic soil. The crops serve as a contingency for times when the berserkers can find neither human nor beast to slaughter. The berserkers also gather lichens from the center of the island-not for nourishment, but because these can provide euphoric visions or fuel the berserkers\\' battle rage. Continued consumption of these lichens is the cause of the Kalva berserkers\\' white eyes.'},\n",

Freyr Darkwine, the castellan of Hagreach, leads the Blackravens, whose main headquarters is a granite fortress called Blackraven Hall, situated next to the Rimef low River near the border with Irrisen. While the Blackravens count among their number a wide range of individuals from varying races and classes, those most commonly encountered are scouts that patrol the rivers and roads throughout this borderland. These scouts undergo specific training against their hated enemies, and are all rangers specialized in fighting in subarctic conditions. A typical Blackraven patrol contains four to six members. In the open terrain around the Rimef low River, Blackraven patrols are sometimes mounted on horseback, but in less hospitable places they sometimes use dog sleds, skis, or snowshoes. They patrol the border regularly but in no set pattern, making it difficult to predict their movements. A Blackraven dons pale leather armor when he needs to blend into snowy environs, or when on reconnaissance missions into Irrisen. Blackraven scouts make extensive use of animal messenger spells to maintain communication over large areas. Specialists at battling trolls, Blackravens typically carry flaming arrows and alchemical fire to inhibit the creatures' regeneration and destroy their remains.\"},\n",

       "   'description': \"Called the Father of All Linnorms, Fafnheir is the oldest and mightiest of his kind to dwell upon Golarion-other, even more powerful linnorms exist on the First World, but on Golarion, Fafnheir is king. Crafty and powerful, Fafnheir is more than just a creature of rage or hunger, and is sometimes known to speak with those who come to him as supplicants for his wisdom. Tales say that to gain Fafnheir's advice, one must travel through Grungir Forest to the cavern entrance of the linnorm's lair, whereupon the supplicant must call into the opening several secret names for the ancient linnorm. A single step into the lair renders the supplication moot, for Fafnheir does not suffer intrusions. It is customary to bring a herd of sheep, oxen, or several thralls for him to feast upon. Those who find Fafnheir in a talkative mood and live to tell the tale report that the linnorm is well versed in numerous fields, and capable of working a wide range of magic through wishcrafting, though how much of his bragging is true is debatable. Fafnheir claims to have been the first linnorm to cross to Golarion from the First World after slaying three of that realm's Eldest, as well as to remember a time when the dragon god Dahak came to this world, and to have taken part in ancient battles against humanity as an ally of the serpentfolk. Certain Thassilonian accounts give support to his claim of providing advice and aid at times to Runelord Xanderghul, and he endured the Age of Darkness with ease. The past few thousand years have passed in the blink of an eye for the ancient linnorm, and he expects to survive for thousands more. Fafnheir is aware of the prophecy that the hero who kills him will become king of all Ulfen. The linnorm also knows that in death he will be reborn from the burnt flesh of his slayer, and suggests to those who raise this topic with him that only by becoming him can such a Linnorm King rule. While Fafnheir has seen many challengers, few have offered him a true battle. Fafnheir spends much of his time slumbering, but wakes quickly at the slightest deviation in the patterns of the world around him, and his dreaming mind touches the woods above and the blood of his children. Those who would come upon him unawares should not expect success unless they travel into his lair from other worlds, for his attunement to Grungir Forest is uncanny. The linnorm rarely ventures far from his lair, preferring to lure his enemies close and dispatch them on familiar ground. He loves nothing but his treasure, and cannot be bribed or threatened-the lure of potential treasure does not excite him nearly as much as what he already possesses. He is a subtle combatant, preferring to use trickery before launching into melee. Unlike his lesser kin, Fafnheir has a number of potent, if limited, spell-like abilities, and he often uses his limited wishes to great effect. He has long experience with direct confrontation, and his millennia of action have taught him tricks that few remember. He is one of the most deadly creatures in the Inner Sea region, and even the mightiest dragons fear his power.\"},\n",

A fey animal uses all the base creature\\'s statistics and special abilities except as noted here. CR: Same as the base creature +1. Type: Creature type changes to fey. It gains the augmented subtype. Do not recalculate Hit Dice, Base Attack Bonus, skills, or saves. Alignment: Any chaotic. Armor Class: A fey creature\\'s natural armor bonus increases by +1. Special Qualities and Defenses: A fey animal gains darkvision 60 feet and low-light vision if it didn\\'t already possess it. It also gains DR 5/cold iron (DR 10/cold iron if it has 11 or more Hit Dice) and SR equal to its CR +11. Speed: All of the fey creature\\'s movement speeds increase by 10 feet. Special Attacks: A fey animal gains the special attack described below. Save DCs are equal to 10 +1/2 the fey animal\\'s Hit Dice +the fey animal\\'s Charisma modifier. Death Curse (Su): When a creature slays a fey animal, the slayer is cursed with ill luck unless it makes a successful Will saving throw to resist the curse. If it fails to resist, the victim takes a -2 penalty on all attack rolls, ability checks, skill checks, and saving throws until the curse is removed. The total penalty from multiple fey animal death curses stacks, but the multiple death curses count as a single curse overall for the purposes of removing its effects. A fey creature can see this curse on a creature as an angry red halo around the victim\\'s head. Spell-Like Abilities: A fey animal has a cumulative number of spell-like abilities set by its HD. Unless otherwise noted, an ability is usable 1/day. The CL equals the fey animal\\'s CR. HD Spell-Like Abilities 1-3 charm person, faerie fire 4-6 fly (3/day), tree shape 7-9 charm monster, hallucinatory terrain 10-13 polymorph (3/day), summon nature\\'s ally IV 14-16 feeblemind, transport via plants 17 or higher mass charm monster, summon nature\\'s ally VIII Abilities: Dex +4, Int +10 (to a maximum score of 12), Wis +2, Cha +4. Skills: A fey animal gains a +4 racial bonus on Bluff and Stealth checks, and has skill points per racial Hit Die equal to 6 +its Intelligence modifier. Its racial class skills are Acrobatics, Bluff, Climb, Diplomacy, Fly, Knowledge (nature), Perception, Sense Motive, Stealth, and Swim.

       "   'description': \"A longship captain typically leads a crew of Ulfen raiders, and as such must be as adept at combat as she is at command and tactics. At sea or on land, her steely gaze and authoritative tone ensure that her crew follow her orders quickly and without argument. An accomplished sailor herself, she has the ability to motivate her crew to work in unison and give their best effort-and indeed, to fight and die as necessary. She knows the workings of her ship inside out, often having had a hand in its construction. If the ship needs repairs in the midst of a journey, she proves herself a skilled carpenter and sail maker. If a longship is caught in one of ferocious storms that frequently lash the Steaming Sea, the captain's determination and shouted commands urging all hands to row for their lives are often the only things that prevent the ship from capsizing. Many longship captains prefer to follow coastlines, and at night have their boats seek safe harbor so that the crew can sleep in tents on the nearby shore-in such cases, the captain herself claims the privilege of the sleeping onboard, possibly with an honor guard or skeleton crew to prevent thieves or accidents. If an enemy attacks during the night, the high-walled hull of the ship can serve as an impromptu fortification. In a naval battle, a longboat captain directs both the ship's course and her crew's tactics, all while personally raining down a shower of deadly arrows on the enemy vessel. Most longboat captains are certainly capable in melee combat, but prefer to issue orders and provide support with their arrows from a vantage point from which they can observe the whole battle-often the bows of their ships. A captain's swift reactions, as well as her ability to yell a hasty word of warning or command to her crew, can d e t e r m i n e whether she and her crew face victory or defeat, life or death. When engaged in coastal raiding, the captain supervises the planning of the attack. She often leads a reserve group of raiders to strike against the strongest points of resistance or cut off those trying to flee. Those assigned to the captain's guard see the post as a mark of honor, as well as a chance for a greater share of the loot. A powerful and prosperous captain is often known to have her vessel's figurehead enchanted with the ability to spit out gouts of flame, or so that its eyes glow with an eerie light, casting fear into the hearts of enemies who see it bearing down on them.\"},\n",

A mountain troll prefers to withdraw and observe before entering combat, lumbering forth to attack only if intruders make clear their intentions to harm it or its allies, or if the newcomers seem to be encroaching upon the troll's territory rather than simply passing through. Once enraged, a mountain troll is a savage opponent, calling upon its native strength and alliances with elementals to bury its opponents in stone or spread their entrails across the slopes. Mountain trolls prefer to live in narrow ravines or shallow caves that allow them to look out over the landscape. They sometimes knuckle-walk like a gorilla, but when angered they rear up to their full height of nearly 30 feet. Mountain trolls have a close association with the First World, similar to that possessed by gnomes, which grants them magical abilities and unusual patience. They are quick to forge alliances with fey, and while they see smaller trolls as sadists, they nonetheless feel a sort of familial responsibility. Lesser trolls often capitalize upon mountain trolls' generosity, but take care to abide by their larger cousins' rules when sheltering in their homes. Mountain trolls have even been known to aid explorers or give advice, provided they are treated with respect.\"},\n",

       "   'description': \"Raiders from the Linnorm Kingdoms seek to prove themselves by sailing to distant lands and returning with riches, either obtained by shrewd trading or taken as plunder from a successful raid. All raiders seek to show their courage in battle, fighting fiercely for pillage or honor. While raiding, these barbarians employ the element of surprise; in the faint predawn light, they quietly row their longship with muff led oars as they draw near the targeted settlement. Sometimes Ulfen raiders might put in at a nearby, uninhabited harbor so as to approach their quarry on foot from inland, using nearby terrain as cover. However they approach, the raiders aim to catch their prize unawares to prevent their prey from fleeing with valuable plunder. When a group of raiders attacks, the clamorous sound of their Ulfen war songs floats over the din of battle, and the battle plan changes from stealth to intimidation. While Ulfen raiders have a keen sense of tactics, they prefer to fight as bold individuals, rather than in strict formations, in hopes of gaining personal glory. Once battle commences, Ulfen raiders often form a wedge of spears to drive their way through enemy lines. They use shield wall tactics when outnumbered or when they encounter stiff opposition. After a successful attack, Ulfen raiders quickly gather loot and valuable captives onto their longships. As well as coins and other riches, the raiders often take bulky luxury goods that are hard to obtain in their homeland, such as well-made furniture or carpets, and even appropriate high-pedigree livestock to increase the quality of their own herds. Slaves are often harvested from the ranks of a village's able-bodied youths. While Ulfen raiders seize anything of value that they can bring on board their longships, they are unlikely to wantonly destroy a raided settlement. After all, if the settlement is able to eventually recover from the attack, it can provide more plunder in the next raiding season. In large groups, Ulfen raiders can take over a wide area of countryside, and often demand an exorbitant payment from local leaders to move on. Smaller communities frequently pay, rather than attempting the expensive process of raising an army and then fighting an uncertain battle against these bloodthirsty raiders.\"},\n",

       "   'description': 'Frostfallen creatures are mindless undead infused with icy cold and animated by a hatred for all living things. Their bodies radiate a devastating chill that cloaks them in patches of ice that act as armor. Frostfallen creatures appear otherwise as they did at the time of their reanimation, except for a cold gleam in the eyes. Ecology In the harshest reaches of the world, cold is an ever-present enemy. When a creature dies from exposure to such harsh conditions, bitter anger and the searing cold sometimes combine to reanimate the dead as one of the frostfallen. Once reanimated, frostfallen creatures prowl the cold lands in which they fell, wreaking indiscriminate vengeance on living creatures out of spiteful rage. Although frostfallen creatures can be created through necromantic magic like other undead, arcane scholars are fascinated by the necromancy that brings frostfallen creatures to unlife, for the animating force is a synthesis of negative energy and a bone-numbing cold. This cold empowers the creature\\'s attacks, wreathing its natural weapons in a deathly chill. Those who have fought these creatures describe great wounds instantly numbed by the lethal touch of frostbite. In addition, a frostfallen creature\\'s body emanates an aura of cold that flash-freezes moisture in the air around it, coating the creature in a patchwork of ice capable of def lecting blows from even the heaviest weapons. The creature\\'s affinity for cold also allows it to locate nearby warm-blooded creatures, even in driving blizzards and on moonless nights. Frostfallen creatures move with the same gaits they had in life, while gaining a savage surge in physical power. Additionally, unlike normal zombies, the frozen condition of the creature fortifies its unlife, making it extremely durable. Indeed, throughout the northern reaches of Avistan, legends persist of specific frostfallen mammoths, dire bears, and even giants that have hunted the Crown of the World for centuries. Habitat & Society The corrupt animus that powers frostfallen creatures imbues them with a hatred of all living things, and most spend their time wandering wintry terrains near where they died, looking for life to snuff out. Sometimes, vestiges of behavior from their original forms lead to groups banding together, like frostfallen wolves that hunt in packs. Even those frostfallen that have never encountered others of their kind seem to instinctively recognize their own, and band together if prey is nearby. In Irrisen, winter witches and other ice casters prefer creating frostfallen creatures, as such creatures\\' bodies more readily withstand the decay and brittleness often faced by skeletons and zombies in harsh northern climes. Casters who create frostfallen creatures often use minor magic to emblazon a creature\\'s ice armor with carvings or specific colors, effectively branding the creature as a servant. On rare occasions, casters will create frostfallen creatures in warmer regions like the Mwangi Expanse or the deserts of Thuvia. Despite the scorching heat of such places, frostfallen creatures retain all of their powers. In such cases, the undead\\'s creator normally employs her minions against creatures that are susceptible to the frostfallen creature\\'s freezing attacks. Some frostfallen creatures have even survived independent of their creators. When such a rarity comes to pass, the frostfallen creature simply begins hunting the region for fresh life to end, though it will often lie in wait in cooler places like deep caves, or under the water of an oasis so as to better ambush creatures and travelers who would never expect to see a frostfallen creature so far south. Animating a Frostfallen Creature A magic-user can create any form of frostfallen creature by casting animate dead upon the corpse to be animated and providing an amount of ice of equal weight, plus two blue topazes or turquoises worth at least 100 gp each. The creator can only create a number of Hit Dice of frostfallen creatures equal to the amount allowed by animate dead. Frostfallen creatures count against the number of Hit Dice of skeletons and zombies that can be created using animate dead. Creating a Frostfallen Creature \"Frostfallen creature\" is an acquired template that can be added to any corporeal creature (other than an undead), referred to hereafter as the base creature. A frostfallen creature uses the base creature\\'s statistics and special abilities except as noted here. CR: As base creature +1. Alignment: Always neutral evil. Type: The creature\\'s type changes to undead and it gains the cold subtype. It retains any subtypes except for alignment subtypes (such as good) and subtypes that indicate kind (such as giant). It does not gain the augmented subtype. It uses all the base creature\\'s statistics and special abilities except as noted here. Armor Class: The natural armor bonus improves by +4. Hit Dice: A frostfallen creature drops any HD gained from class levels and changes racial HD to d8s. Creatures without racial HD are treated as if they had 1 racial HD. A skeleton uses its Charisma modifier (instead of its Constitution modifier) to determine bonus hit points. Defensive Abilities: Frostfallen creatures gain DR 5/ bludgeoning (or DR 10/bludgeoning if it has 11 HD or more). They are immune to cold. Weaknesses: Frostfallen creatures gain vulnerability to fire. Speed: A winged frostfallen creature\\'s maneuverability drops to clumsy. If the base creature flew magically, its fly speed is unchanged. Retain all other movement types. Attacks: A frostfallen creature retains all the natural weapons, manufactured weapon attacks, and weapon proficiencies of the base creature. It also gains a slam attack that deals damage based on the frostfallen creature\\'s size, but as if it were one size category larger than its actual size. Special Attacks: A frostfallen creature retains all of the base creature\\'s special attacks and also gains the following. Cold (Su): A frostfallen creature\\'s body generates intense cold, dealing an amount of cold damage with its touch determined by its Hit Dice. Creatures attacking a frostfallen creature with unarmed strikes or natural weapons take this same cold damage each time one of their attacks hits. Frostfallen Creature Hit Dice Cold Damage 1-5 1d6 6-10 2d6 11-15 3d6 16+4d6 Abilities: A frostfallen creature\\'s Strength increases by +2 and its Charisma by +6. A frostfallen creature has no Constitution or Intelligence score, and its Wisdom becomes 10. BAB: A frostfallen creature\\'s base attack bonus is equal to 3/4 of its Hit Dice. Skills: A frostfallen creature loses all skill ranks possessed by the base creature and gains none of its own. Feats: A frostfallen creature loses all feats possessed by the base creature and gains Toughness as a bonus feat. Special Qualities: A frostfallen creature loses most special qualities of the base creature. It retains any extraordinary special qualities that improve its melee or ranged attacks. It also gains the following special quality. Lifesense (Su): The frostfallen creature notices and locates living creatures within 60 feet, just as if it possessed the blindsight ability.'},\n",

       "   'description': 'Atamahuta are immensely strong oni spirits who have donned the physical guise of ettins. Combining oni\\'s trademark guile with ettins\\' unadulterated brawn, atamahuta use their two-headed forms to inf lict as much damage as possible by fusing their arcane powers with their distinctive melee combat style. Because of the raw power they infuse into the bodies they inhabit, atamahuta are slightly bigger than normal ettins. An atamahuta is 14 feet tall and weighs 5,500 pounds. Ecology While many might think an atamahuta possesses two heads and is therefore made up of two distinct oni, each being is composed of only one oni spirit. When an atamahuta takes form, it divides its powers into two parts, granting one half of its being its ingenuity and magical prowess and the other its anger and savage strength. An ettin\\'s body is the most suitable for this division of powers, which manifests itself physically as one head having a seeming dominance over the other. The atamahuta\\'s right head most directly controls its actions in physical combat, and is also the only one that talks; the left head, meanwhile, constantly spills nonsense words and mutterings under its breath, and is the source of the oni\\'s arcane power. Oni scholars have speculated that an individual atamahuta\\'s underlying, unvoiced wishes and desires are encoded in the gibberish that burbles from its left head, and that by listening closely enough, one can garner valuable information about the oni spirit, but few have survived an atamahuta encounter long enough to test this theory. Regardless of whatever babbling the left head produces, most witnesses agree that atamahuta strive for power and fear-induced respect more than anything else, and will go to grotesque lengths to garner them, through means both violent and utterly despicable. Atamahuta possess the ability to change shape just as other oni, but the visage of an uncontrollably violent ettin is often even more horrifying to civilized creatures than that of an oni, whom most regard as equally evil but at least somewhat reasonable. Thus, most atamahuta find it beneficial to procure a silver-tongued ally who can act as a gateway to the more powerful and wise oni itself. Once they have established control over a certain realm, atamahuta will usually either kill or enslave their allies, seeing the beguilers as potential threats to their rule. Atamahuta have little patience for any individual that wastes their time, and oversee their domain with an unforgiving and steadfast fist. Oni who inhabit the form of an ettin usually possess violent and unruly dispositions to begin with, but most know better than to act brashly when they first arrive in their physical forms and keep their rage at bay-at least until they establish their dominion over the lesser beings around them. Habitat & Society Atamahuta resemble ettins in both temperament and physical form, but their similarities end here. Most atamahuta look down upon the monstrous giants as barbaric, imperfect versions of an ideal form, and impose their superior strength and intellect upon the creatures in order to enslave them. While a single atamahuta can easily coerce and garner the aid of several ettins, the oni tend to establish elaborate slave rings in order to most effectively \"recruit\" high numbers of individuals, including ettins as well as other intelligent humanoids. Several atamahuta oversee the operation, while their shackled minions act as both enforcers of the slavers\\' rules and prisoners themselves, hoping to garner some miniscule form of freedom through cooperation. Their sheer cunning allows atamahuta to trick their prisoners into thinking this, when in reality the only escape an atamahuta\\'s slave can hope to achieve is through transfer to another owner or death. When atamahuta establish slave rings, they often make a business of selling their prisoners to the highest bidder in private auctions and black market deals. Occasionally, atamahuta will also run economically viable businesses on the side, putting their enslaved minions to work in remote fields or mines far from civilization. Atamahuta are rarely content to remain rulers over a stagnant position, and seek to advance their dominion as far as possible. Their prowess for ruthless business tactics and intimidating rivals into positions of subservience makes them potent forces in whatever realm they seek to control. Atamahuta often join merchants\\' guilds and other such organizations after starting their slave rings, creating legitimate business fronts in order to infiltrate the guilds and wrest control of them. With this power, they can impose seemingly fair taxes upon their competitors, ultimately running them out of business and establishing themselves as the sole means of trade within a community. Of course, they must do this all through surrogates, as few trade organizations would permit an oni or an ettin into their ranks, and even then, many guilds have imposed strict rules regarding representatives into their systems in order to prevent such atamahuta-run monopolies from developing in the first place. Atamahuta are typically distrustful of other oni, as they see them as potential threats to their power, and thus only rarely ally themselves with other such beings. Occasionally, however, such alliances can prove to be mutually beneficial, and so atamahuta team up with weaker oni such as yamabushi tengus or kuwa, so that they can reap the rewards of such a coalition while still retaining the most power. More intelligent or powerful oni recognize atamahuta for their oblivious nature and will often manipulate the beings for their strength, tricking the ettin-shaped oni into thinking they are dominant in the friendship until the more powerful oni has used the atamahuta for their intended purpose, at which point the beings are swiftly discarded.'},\n",

       "   'description': 'This leathery-faced creature stands tall and upright, with long, simian limbs and a shaggy coat. Intelligent and powerful, saumen kars are not naturally aggressive, but the hostility of their environment forces them to defend the land that supports them with ferocity, even to the death. Their natural coloration and snow-packed fur make saumen kars almost invisible among the drifts of their icy homes, leading many arctic races to refer to them as \"men of snow.\" A long-forgotten deal made by their race in its infancy still brutally scars the body of each saumen kar, marking them with their distinctive frostbite brands-though if this debt is already paid, lapsed, or growing ever greater, none can remember. An adult saumen kar stands 12 feet tall and weighs almost 2,000 pounds, but the ice and snow matted to its fur for both insulation and armor add another 1,000 pounds to its bulk. Ecology These solitary creatures eke out a bitter existence across the equally bitter landscape of the Crown of the World, their origins a mystery even to themselves. They are nomadic, roaming the wastes to settle temporarily where they are lucky enough to find food, shelter, or both. They are omnivorous, but the climate dictates that the lion\\'s share of their diet is meat, and saumen kars consume the flesh of any creature but their own kind. Generation to generation, saumen kars pass down the ice crafting techniques that supply them with weapons, tools, and art. Occasionally a saumen kar\\'s lair contains crude ice replicas of common Erutaki implements, from storage jars to skinning tools, or even heavy-lidded ice chests. Finding their frozen works among the possessions of another race is rare, however, since saumen kar ice artifacts rarely last long outside of arctic environments. The crude frostbite brands that mark every adult saumen kar\\'s flesh are the gruesome expression of an ancient pact with an otherworldly being, still honored by saumen kars for both spiritual and practical reasons. The specifics of the pact are long forgotten, but some Erutaki elders believe the men of snow protect something in the wastes that they have themselves forgotten. While the meaning of the brands may have become lost to their wearers, scholars of language recognize the runes as a form of ancient Giant. Even still, only one well versed in linguistics can identify the sole rune still rendered well enough to read: \"favored.\" The runes\\' powers lead many to believe the saumen kars owe their protection to one of the numerous powers of the North, such as Hshrha, the Duchess of All Winds; the Empyreal Lord Tolc; or entities mysterious to natives of more temperate lands, though the implication of the runes being an ancient form of the Giant language also creates an unsettling link between these arctic warriors and the Deathless Frost, Kostchtchie. Whichever way other races choose to speculate, the saumen kars believe the brands\\' protections come from their reverence for the deadly forces of the world\\'s summit, and they display their scars proudly, wearing no clothing or armor but the snow matted into their dense fur. Habitat & Society The Crown of the World is an unforgiving place, and the saumen kars have learned that survival is best achieved alone or in very small groups. It is rare to meet more than one of their kind at a time, although folklore does tell of handfuls of saumen kars banding together against a particularly serious or wide-ranging threat. Wandering the wastes alone, they throw up temporary lairs wherever food or ice cliffs can be found, moving off when they have taken what they can from the land. A typical lair is little more than a rough-walled igloo or ice cave built by hefting large amounts of snow and packing it tight around the hemispheres of ice they create, before the magical effect expires. Saumen kars\\' antisocial behavior is what keeps them rare, and indeed mating is almost incidental, occurring when a male\\'s and favorably disposed female\\'s paths happen to cross. New families rarely stay together for long, and for a creature with a lifespan of up to 300 years, their offspring grow at an alarming rate, and learn to fend for themselves early in life. Saumen kars worship the land and the powers of the North rather than any specific deity, leading to a druidic dominance of their spiritual lives. In their final days, some saumen kars travel to sites of great natural beauty or power to die in a place where the blackened bones of many generations are tumbled together beneath ever-shifting ice and snow. From what little outsiders can gather, they are a loosely shamanic people, and some carry crude family reliquaries of teeth, bones, and fur for ancestral protection and guidance. Saumen kars speak a dialect of Giant inf luenced by Druidic, though they rarely communicate with other races. Some saumen kars, through necessity, have picked up smatterings of the Erutaki languages and even a word or two of Common, but their knowledge of such languages never extends beyond a handful of crude threats and warnings. Survival in the wastes is about understanding its dangers, environmental or otherwise, and despite their primitive, animalistic appearance, saumen kars are canny combatants. Over thousands of years their proud race has learned patience and silence from the glaciers. Rather than risk a frontal assault, they utilize their natural coloration to hide in snow banks and their ability to summon powerful ursine aid to scare off enemies or track those who trespass upon their lands. Only if interlopers prove a match for their summoned allies will they cautiously join the fray, trapping physically stronger creatures in icy hemispheres or separating groups with freezing planes. They then wade in, the field rearranged to their advantage, to use their imposing size, savage axe blows, and incapacitating headbutts to cut down weaker opponents, or take snowstorm form to shred dangerous spellcasters with blinding, razor-sharp sleet.'},\n",

       "   'description': \"Dosojins are kami that take the form of stone icons and watch over roads and trails. They are often found in statue form at the edges of villages, along mountain passes, at the beginnings of tunnels and other major works of roadway construction, or at simple country crossroads. In urban areas, dosojins can sometimes be found on street corners and near bridges. They serve as the guardians of travelers, keeping the malicious and malevolent off the paths they diligently watch over. Wise travelers know to seek a dosojin's blessing before traveling upon its ward, for falling out of favor with the kami of travel is a sure way to become lost or hampered. Pious mortal couples also seek out dosojin for their own reasons, as the kami are often regarded as patrons of fertility, and are known for their habit of choosing mates and standing beside one another for their entire lives. In many regions, the blessing of a dosojin is believed to ensure a long and happy marriage, as well as many healthy children. The average dosojin stands about 4-1/2 feet tall and weighs upward of 400 pounds. Ecology As creatures that symbolize travel and connections, dosojins straddle the line between the lands of the civilized and the wild, often with one foot literally in each. Dosojins spend most of their time guarding their chosen sites in the form of nondescript statues and way markers, meditating motionlessly for seasons at a time. While semi-social dosojins within cities and other settlements are not uncommon, the majority of these kami stand along remote and secluded roads, going to great lengths to ensure that their true identity is not known. It is not uncommon for dosojins to create false duplicates of themselves using their stone shape ability, and these misleading markers inspire a certain amount of faith among those who look out for the kami of roads, as one can rarely tell if a sculpture is a dosojin by looks alone. A dosojin requires no sustenance, but it is not uncommon for travelers to leave offerings for a silent watcher, usually tributes of fruits, nuts, and potables, gifts that the kami gladly shares with hungry travelers, happy to inspire such good faith among passersby and to foster a system of give-and-take between strangers. Dosojins are fond of the creatures that traverse their roads and trails, and maintain the roadways they guard to ensure both the ward's survival and the safe travel of the voyagers that traverse it. Though they have an aff inity for the creatures that constructed their roadways, dosojins still protect their wards with the aggressive righteousness typical of all kami, and scarcely hesitate when faced with an oni or other evildoer seeking to disrupt the balance. Dosojin have little patience for those who litter on their roadways or unnecessarily obstruct the paths, and they take it upon themselves to discipline those they deem worthy of punishment. Rarely violent in an overt sense, dosojins prefer to use their magic in order to trick travelers into becoming lost, letting the wilds they travel through become the primary instruments of their demise. Dosojins prove quite deadly to those who fail to show kami proper respect, as they use their powers of illusion to lead troublesome caravans into impassible ravines and destructive oni onto unsound, derelict bridges. Habitat & Society Dosojins are odd among kami in that they are known to select mates from among their own kind, and it is not uncommon to see two seemingly redundant statues standing next to one another near a trailhead or fork in the road. While they do not reproduce in any typical sense of the word, dosojins are nonetheless sought out by mortal couples hoping to conceive, as many people see the kami as symbols of fertility. However, most scholars agree that dosojins do not collaborate in this way to foster fecundity, but rather act as symbols of camaraderie and companionship for travelers on their roads, encouraging teamwork and cooperation among groups of diverse individuals with a shared goal. While most dosojins are content to watch over particular highways or roads for their entire existences and act as helpful guardians for most passersby, some choose instead to act as appraisers of travelers' skills and bravery. Cunning individuals that indulge in acts of trickery more often than their tamer brethren, these rogue dosojins craft obstacles and trials for travelers they deem worthy of the challenge. The tests are not meant to substantially impede voyagers, and are simply forms of innocent fun that a dosojin uses to gauge the strength and resolve of various wayfarers. Those who surpass a dosojin's challenges (which usually take the form of puzzles or illusions) earn the kami's respect and the assurance of safe travel throughout the rest of its domain, while those who avoid the obstacle or overcome it through brutish and witless means garner only scorn. Careful travelers know to watch out for the statuelike kami when making their way along potentially protected roads, as the guardians expect voyagers to act honorably and respectfully while travelling upon their paths. Some of the most important mandates to keep in mind when interacting with dosojin and walking through their territories are as follows. • Mortals who respect the land and its laws shall know no harm. • Mortals who fail to show proper reverence for tradition shall not pass by a dosojin upon the first attempt. • Mortals who actively harm the natural world shall be cursed to wander it. • Mortals who stray from a dosojin's path to do harm should not expect to find that path ever again.\"},\n",

       "   'description': \"Spiritual guardians of ornamental shrubs and miniature trees, fukujin are highly regarded among Tians as bringers of good fortune and sound wisdom. Fukujins are thought to only come to goodhearted and devoted bonsai gardeners, and since bonsai plants are often only cultivated by astute and aesthetically minded humanoids, the kami are usually of a similar nature, speaking to mortals rarely and always cryptically. Regardless of how much of their coveted knowledge they impart upon favored mortals, however, fukujins always bring with them a sense of hope and good luck, and almost all within close proximity of the kami feel an instant sense of relief. Fukujins resemble humanoids with tree branches protruding from their bodies, most often their heads, and some fukujins possess leafy hair or treelike limbs. A fukujin in its physical form is only as tall as its bonsai ward-usually only a foot or two-and weighs less than 30 pounds. Ecology While many see the art of bonsai gardening as humanoids' attempts at controlling or forming nature, fukujins ref lect the practice's virtues of patience and nurturing. Fukujins maintain that a moment of patience and study can reveal multitudes more than years of trial and error, and the diminutive beings spread this knowledge wherever they go. While kami do not reproduce in any typical sense, fukujins are known to sow seeds of bonsai plants in the wake of their footsteps, further delighting communities that appreciate such flora. Though assignment of kami remains up to the mysterious will of the gods, fukujins do their part in creating numerous hosts for these spirits. The health and strength of the tree branch protruding from a fukujin's head is often said to be a good indicator of the skill of the warded bonsai tree's caretaker. While the aesthetic values of bonsai trees are often completely subjective, the kami spirits are evidence that there is perhaps a series of core doctrines bonsai farmers should adhere to when taking care of their plants-ideals that a gardener can strive toward to ensure he achieves success in his maintenance of the small tree. A poorly trimmed bonsai plant may sicken the spirit for a time, for instance, while expert grafting can result in a strong or knowledgeable kami. In most cases, however, a kami will almost always leave its ward if a bonsai gardener neglects the plant long enough or effectively ruins the effort, for though fukujins are patient, they have little tolerance for the virtues of negligence and wastefulness. While nearly all fukujins are calm, collected, and patient spirits, the beings are by no means all the same, as their physical appearances, predispositions, and demeanors are just as often reflections of the particular bonsai plant that they watch over. Fukujins who reside within the hearts of deciduous trees, for example, tend to be of lighter color as well as more airy and spirited than the hardy and resilient fukujins of coniferous shrubs, who take on a red, earthy hue. Plant type can also hint at particular magical qualities the spirit might have-white-trunked trees tend to attract gaunter, more fatalistic individuals, while plants with brown or ebon bark inspire kami that are more attuned to the energies and mysteries of magic. The tree branch that sticks out of a fukujin's head while the spirit is in its physical form is often of the same variety as the bonsai tree that the kami protects, though exceptions have been known to exist among particularly dual-natured spirits. Habitat & Society Since their wards are by nature the direct result of humanoid intervention, fukujins are naturally social creatures, and most seek to assist their humanoid partners in not only cultivating beautiful plants, but in all spheres of life. Many bonsai gardeners are often content to live in a permanent home, establish a family, and live a life of tranquility, and fukujins happily provide all manner of advice regarding these domestic issues. In other instances, however, fukujins have been known to travel alongside particularly adventurous cultivators, humanoids who keep the shrubbery and kami spirit in safe and comfortable packs or pouches and consult them for wisdom in circumstances both dire and unusual. The miniature kami's insights and good luck prove as useful in the heat of battle as in the hearthstone, and so humanoids from nearly all walks of life seek the favor of these beings. Bonsai trees are delicate plants and their kami ref lect this fragility. What they lack in physical defenses, however, fukujins make up for in grace and keen insight, using their natural acumen to avoid and deter hazards before they're even encountered. Some might mistakenly see this expert passiveness as a manifestation of fukujins' philanthropic ideals and good intentions, but more often than not their flightiness is simply what they deem to be the wisest course of action. In situations where violence is inevitable, fukujins seek the aid of stronger individuals to help protect them, true to the tradition of their wards' reliance on humanoid intervention and maintenance. Rather than view this reliance on humanoids as a weakness, however, most fukujins accept it as part of a long-lasting transaction between the two forces, each providing unique benefits to the other throughout the relationship. To bolster this partnership, fukujins harness healing powers as well as the strength of their insight, ensuring that their caretakers remain healthy and able to protect the kami and their wards. While they almost always possess pertinent and useful advice, fukujins are known for being reserved under most circumstances, sharing what knowledge they have only when it is absolutely necessary, and they never share wisdom superfluously. Fukujins are normally individualistic and solitary like the plants they watch over, and when they interact with one another they usually do so telepathically. What people often perceive as the luck of fukujins is often merely the result of wise advice garnered from the spirits, though when asked if the kami really are bringers of fortune, fukujins are known to remain even more tight-lipped than usual. Occasionally one might encounter a fukujin in the wild, in lands far from the societies and plants where they commonly make their homes. In such cases, these miniature kami often claim shrubs, young plants, and even whimiscal-looking mushrooms as their wards, grooming nearby groves and glades into quiet meditation gardens or into artistic shapes, inviting visitors to rest and reflect.\"},\n",

       "   'description': \"Kaminaris are robust spirits of enormous size that watch over the balance of weather, taking the form of violent storms wherever they go. More monstrous-looking and boisterous than most kami, kaminaris are often mistaken for oni upon first glance, their unpredictable natures furthering the confusion. Kaminaris care little for most mortals, primarily concerning themselves with the maintenance and protection of their wards-enormous storm clouds that represent the awesome power of thunder and lightning. In addition to their duties guarding their storm wards and the balance of weather, kaminaris are endlessly fascinated with musical instruments, particularly drums. Kaminaris have vibrant skin and equally colorful features; the specific hues vary from kaminari to kaminari. A kaminari stands roughly 25 feet tall and weighs about 10 tons. Ecology Though a kaminari commands the awe-inspiring powers of lightning and thunder as though they were simply extensions of itself, the kami of storms have limited power over their wards. As dictated by the obscure and convoluted Laws of Golden Perfection, a kaminari has only limited ability to will its ward to travel in any particular direction or halt its movement for a modest amount of time per day. Thus it is often merely a passenger upon the clouds of a storm. Though most storms collect and dissipate with some frequency, a kami-inhabited storm is more permanent than most weather patterns, and as long as both the kami and its ward are neither destroyed nor corrupted, the storm could exist for a potentially infinite amount of time. Kaminaris despise the use of magic to alter weather patterns, and attempts to disrupt their storm clouds often result in the enormous kami's unabashed and wrathful ire. A kaminari is as volatile as the storm it protects, and the powerful spirit is quick to exterminate any creature-mortal or otherwise-it deems a threat to the natural balance of weather. Whether an evil sorcerer is trying to bring devastation to a seaside town by calling forth powerful hurricanes or a benevolent wizard is summoning rain to save a desert city in the midst of a natural drought, if such manipulation comes to the attention of the watchful and wandering kaminaris, they find little forgiveness. This is not to suggest that the kami of storms are evil-their threshold for nuisances is simply lower than most kami, and their punishments more destructive. Habitat & Society Floating thousands of feet above most civilizations, kaminaris are usually isolated from other creatures, and this suits the reclusive kami just fine. A kaminari does not interfere with the matters of mortals beyond the natural destruction caused by its storm clouds, and only aides such diminutive creatures when the task would be required of it because of some stricture of the Laws of Golden Perfection. Once a kaminari has fulfilled its required duty, it is only too happy to continue on its way, where it can remain uninterrupted as it creates its music and fills the air around it with thunder and lightning. A kaminari is as devoted to its ward as it is to the practice of music, and the intensity of the storm it sits upon usually corresponds to the amount of aggression with which it plays its instrument. While it rarely cares to interact with mortals, tending first and foremost to its ward, a kaminari may entertain the idea of interacting with a fellow virtuoso. Kaminaris thus have a great affection for bards who practice an instrument, and will occasionally interrupt their diligent guardianship of their storm if doing so allows them the opportunity to play with a skillful accompanist. Amateurs need not apply, as the immortal kaminaris are often among the best players of their instruments, commanding powers of music so stirring that even the most talented bard might have trouble keeping up. A kaminari goes to great lengths to surround itself with booming noise, and is rarely seen without its instrument of choice. While most kaminaris prefer to use drums and other percussion instruments to fill the air around them with sound, rare individuals also adhere to the use of keyboard, string, and wind instruments. The powers of these kaminaris do not greatly differ, but their choice of instrument is usually a fair indicator of their temperament as well as the kind of storm they travel upon-those who play keyboards are usually found amid desert-quenching storms that wander arid environments, bringing with them the power of tornadoes and dust storms; players of string instruments tend toward oceanic environs, residing within the hearts of devastating hurricanes of incredible magnitude far out at sea; and kaminaris who use wind instruments occupy blizzards, commanding the powers of the ice and snow that constantly whip about them.\"},\n",

       "   'description': \"Suijins are the kami of lakes, ponds, springs, and wells. When they are not merged with their wards, these spirits of nature resemble giant carp or sea serpents, usually beautiful specimens with rainbow scales. While they are as benevolent and well meaning as all other kami, suijins are often mistaken for beasts of the waters they inhabit, and are thus feared by superstitious or simple-minded creatures. Those who encounter suijins know better than to believe such unfounded fears, however, as the kami often only emerge from their wards in order to protect innocent creatures in trouble near its waters. Considered reclusive even by other kami, a suijin usually tries to protect creatures within its wards by covert means if at all possible, slowing the flow of its waters' currents or pushing struggling creatures to shore via magic. Suijins are infinitely patient, and though most enjoy helping creatures, those in more remote regions are just as content to simply exist among their waters, protecting their wards from those who would seek to defile them. The general attitude among most suijins is often one of simple acceptance of things as they are, based on the belief that all things are fluid and subject to change; even the largest lakes are bound to recede or expand, and even the most eternal kami are not entirely permanent, a point proven by the vicious oni. In its true form, a typical suijin is 15 feet long and weighs about 1,200 pounds, though numerous rumors suggest that lesser and greater suijins do exist in some parts of the world, typically residing in bodies of water that are proportionate to the kami's size and power. Ecology A suijin's particular ward is usually a good indicator of its temperament. A suijin residing in a secluded and placid mountain lake is often more calm and forgiving of trespasses than one dwelling in the heart of a turbulent river, and though all suijins typically mean well, those with more tumultuous wards are generally less tolerant of intruders within their domains. For instance, a suijin protecting a natural whirlpool within a larger body of water may not help a passing boat of traders that happens to start sinking into its depths, viewing the ship as a disturbance to the forces of nature. Those suijins who are used to seeing their waterways casually abused by the forces of civilization-as almost all cities in some way impose upon or corrupt the rivers and streams that flow near them, and even farming communities may pollute with manure and runoff-can be much more hard-hearted. Suijins in isolated areas care far less about the mortal world than those who interact with it on a daily basis, so the attitude of a suijin dwelling within a mountain stream is often far different than that of one residing in a regularly visited pond. Travelers can earn the approval of a suijin by placing minerals or gemstones within its ward, and those who pollute the waters or use it for evil (such as by executing innocents via drowning) are quick to encounter a normally calm suijin's fearsome wrath. Unusual floods and droughts are both signs of a suijin's displeasure with a nearby development's effects on the surrounding waters, and wary villagers are careful to appease a suijin and change their destructive ways, lest they feel the full brunt of the powerful water kami's righteous wrath. Those suijins who continually fail to protect their waters from troublesome residents or visitors are often quick to fall out of favor with their kindred, and the wards of these kami often become treacherous during the time in which a corrupted suijin makes its gradual transition toward becoming an oni. Habitat & Society A suijin can occupy virtually any body of water, whether it be a stream up to several dozen miles long or a lake no more than a single mile in diameter. A particularly social suijin might choose to occupy the aqueduct of an urban development if the inhabitants are especially conscious of their impact on the surrounding environs, and such settlements recognize and appreciate the blessing of the benevolent resident, as a suijin cleans and purifies the waters it inhabits. Suijins are solitary kami, and rarely go out of their way to band with others of their kind, preferring instead to protect isolated bodies of water. This form of aloofness isn't out of fear of or apathy for other kami; instead, suijins merely adhere to a loosely established territorial pact, knowing that their powers are more valuable when spread throughout regions, rather than concentrated on particular bodies of water. When suijins do interact with one another, they do so at points where two bodies of water meet, such as estuaries and deltas. If two connecting bodies of water are especially healthy and the suijins residing in them are entirely undisturbed by forces of corruption, it is said that the water kami celebrate nature in a sort of bonding ritual. The rare event can be seen as motes of blue and green light whirling in the shallows of the adjoining water, and scholars speculate that this event may symbolize the creation of a new suijin.\"},\n",

       "   'description': \"A ja noi is an oni spirit that takes the form of a hobgoblin, and differs physically from the hobgoblins in a variety of ways, most notably its unearthly strength and distorted appearance. A ja noi's skin blazes a fiery red rather than a drab gray, and the oni bears prominent ridges on its brow and forehead. Ja noi live to fight. While not as physically powerful as most oni, ja noi nonetheless have an insatiable thirst for combat that drives them to pursue the trials of battle and bloodshed. The sensation of hot blood splattering on a ja noi's skin provokes an adrenaline rush that only fuels its lust for the kill. Its broad, tightly muscled physique and prowess in combat inspire awe within typical hobgoblins, who see the ja noi as a leader who ensures victory in their conquests. Towering over the hobgoblins it resembles, a ja noi stands a little over 6 feet tall and weighs about 220 pounds. Ecology All oni believe the Material Plane's inhabitants fail to take advantage of the wealth of sensations they have at their disposal. While most of these evil spirits inhabit shells and rise to power by working behind the scenes-manipulating others into doing most of their foul deeds for them-ja noi take a more direct approach, conquering and slaughtering any who would stand against them and their armies. Ja noi embrace the carnal joys of slaughter, and no situation is more pleasant to a ja noi than the heat of combat upon a war-ravaged battlef ield. These hardened oni often recognize the inevitable outcome of their warlike tendencies, knowing that death could always be just around the corner; this knowledge, however, only further stimulates their greed for sensation, inspiring them to embrace every fight, as they know it could be their last. A ja noi silences its mind and ignores everything else while on the battlef ield, reveling in the current moment and the sensations of combat: the crunch of bones beneath a worn club, the spray of dying foes' blood, and the scattered guts and heads of fallen brawlers. Like other oni, ja noi possess the ability to change shape, and often use this ability to confuse enemies in the midst of battle, altering their appearances to look like allies, only to bash in an unsuspecting foe's head before the victim knows what's happened. This brutish trickery is usually the extent of a ja noi's guile, however, as the hobgoblin oni are hardly known for their cunning. Even in regard to tactics, ja noi usually implement only the basest plans of action, simply relying on their weaker minions to take the brunt of an opposing army's blow while they target the commanders, always seeking the most worthy challenger and forever striving for that feeling that comes just as one is fighting for one's life. The most powerful ja noi are exceptions to this rule, however, and tales tell of expert ja noi leaders who excel in both physical prowess and tactical wit. These commanders quickly reach the status of generals, and work alongside other oni to manipulate vast armies of soldiers, both humanoid and goblinoid. Once they take physical form, ja noi rarely last more than a couple years on the Material Plane, their deadly lifestyle often a limiting factor in this regard. They either die in battle or at the hands of mutinous troops or allies, minions who realize that they are merely pawns in the game of war that the ja noi is constantly playing. Thus, most of these oni practice their battle skills constantly against one another, their strongest hobgoblin followers, and their adroit adversaries, always fighting and becoming more powerful. While they care little for the arcane, ja noi hone some magical abilities in order to inf lict maximum damage on the battlefield, and a few even seek out magical items to bolster their strength. Habitat & Society Whereas many oni prefer to act alone and in secret, ja noi recognize the concept of strength in numbers, and understand that banding together is often a surer way to glorious victories than lone pursuits. The rare lone ja noi may seek out renowned heroes and martial senseis to challenge in one-on-one combat, but most of these creatures know the best way to demonstrate their prowess is in the midst of the chaotic battlefield in front of other oni, especially fellow ja noi. Often, when ja noi work together to bring carnage to the field of war, they keep track of each other's kills, ranking one another in terms of strength and skill. An individual who shows cowardice repeatedly or does not prove a useful ally swiftly meets the blade of a supposed comrade, as ja noi have little patience for weak accomplices. Ja noi are seen as lowly and primal by other oni, but they possess immense amounts of authority among the lesser hobgoblins around them, and so they surround themselves with these minions, viewing them as useful fodder for the battles to come. During the fight, a ja noi's amateur hobgoblin warriors combat the masses of the opposing army, allowing the prideful oni to engage the commanders. Having found what they consider an ideal militaristic race, ja noi prefer to use hobgoblins for their war campaigns if possible, though they settle for other soldiers if doing so clearly benefits the oni and they have the mortals' unquestioning loyalty. More often, a ja noi will employ non-hobgoblin minions to serve as slaves or some other form of chattel, putting them to work crafting armor and weapons or cleaning up during the aftermath of a successful battle. In rare cases, more powerful oni ask ja noi to lead armies against particularly stubborn groups of opponents. Ja noi rarely refuse such requests, knowing that much blood will be shed in the ventures-and that denying the requests of stronger oni is a sure path to a quick death. Like all oni, ja noi despise and seek out kami, reveling in the destruction of minor spirits and hunting the more powerful individuals for the sheer challenge of it. Because of the strictures of the Laws of Golden Perfection, ja noi cannot directly slay kami, and so they work to direct their vicious hobgoblin armies to complete the task instead. In extremely rare cases, when they have no campaigns to wage and no humanoid enemies to battle, ja noi simply disappear into the wilderness to fight the mightiest creatures they can find. Laying waste to big game such as bulettes and owlbears can distract a ja noi between large-scale battles, but it doesn't take long before the natural warrior quickly feels the lust for battle surge within it once again. Given too much time between skirmishes, a ja noi might turn its violent attention toward its followers, slaughtering entire hobgoblin tribes out of frustration and madness. Canny hobgoblins in service to a bloodthirsty ja noi are wise to find opposing groups for the oni to battle, that the resulting conf lict might temporarily sate the ja noi's incessant desire for war.\"},\n",

       "   'description': \"Erodaemons personify death by heartbreak. These fiends pose as mortals, insert themselves into the lives of their victims, and slowly destroy them. They break apart marriages, kill children or cause them to leave their families, destroy reputations, extinguish faith, curdle family ties, and bit by bit savor the slow disintegration of their victims' emotional well-being and consequent physical deterioration. Every tear shed, every sobbing woman, and every grieving man brings a rapturous smile to an erodaemon's face, because when a mortal dies of heartbreak and grief, the erodaemon feasts upon the tortured soul. The typical erodaemon stands 6 feet tall and weighs 150 pounds. Ecology Erodaemons sometimes form from the hunted, the wandering mortal souls of Abaddon. Corrupted by their heartbreak, the resulting erodaemons seek to impose their morbid fate upon others. Erodaemons are thought by some to be Abaddon's answer to the demonic succubi and diabolic erinyes, possessing the visage of beautiful mortals, yet tainted with obviously fiendish traits and intentions. However, rather than inspiring wars based on lust or torturing victims ceaselessly, erodaemons seek to stoke the flames of mortal woe, causing many to fall into such pits of melancholy that they ultimately perish. When a mortal succumbs to death as a way to escape the pain of living without one's love, an erodaemon ensnares the soul and feasts upon its anguish. Though they can appear as either a man or woman to their victims, in their true form, erodaemons are predominantly female. Erodaemons freely adopt whatever guises they deem necessary to infiltrate and ravage the lives of the mortals they hunt throughout the planes, and when not donning mortal figures, they often shift between various forms as they so desire, honing their ability to adopt each particular gender's behavioral quirks for when it matters. Habitat & Society Erodaemons know many traditions of different societies due to their intrusions into urban areas on other planes. In Abaddon, however, such communal grounds are rare, if they exist at all. In the sprawling wastes, erodaemons practice their forms of seduction primarily upon the hunted, who may still have such base desires as intimacy and love. Erodaemons are rarely trusted by other daemons, who have no hearts to break but can be tricked all the same into thinking a supposed ally or leader has turned its back on them. While infiltrating other planes, erodaemons prefer to hunt alone most of the time. Selecting a particularly susceptible victim-such as one whose heart already throbs for another-an erodaemon will assume the guise of its target's lover and make the victim believe his or her partner is unfaithful, abusive, or worse. The devastation this causes for both of the real members of the relationship is delectable to the erodaemon, whose kiss snatches any life that still remains in the souls of those whose hearts it breaks. Similarly, an erodaemon might simply assume the form of a beautiful suitor, bewitching an already devoted mortal into relations which will ultimately be discovered suddenly by his or her mate. When the affair is revealed-often in the bedroom-the erodaemon assumes its true form to devour the emotionally shattered remains of both parties involved. Erodaemons occasionally work together, but only if doing so results in a greater harvest of crushed mortal souls. This usually involves mesmerizing entire groups of people, often at a risqué performance or event, and seductively sapping the life from the unwitting spectators. While such ruses are elaborate enough to pique erodaemons' peculiar tastes, the act of tricking mortals on an individual level often yields much more broken-and thus all the more delicious-souls. Given their diverse uses and unique insights into mortals, erodaemons serve all of the Four equally. In addition to typical erodaemon servitors, erodaemons with particularly specialized skill sets serve each Horseman as his or her needs require. Apollyon possesses access to a group of plagued erodaemons who act as jubilant and seductive carriers of venereal diseases; Trelmarixian's erodaemons target rulers of kingdoms in order to divert resources meant for food; Szuriel's erodaemons woo entire legions of soldiers into embittered deaths; and Charon's erodaemons seek and further destroy the hearts of the aged.\"},\n",

       "   'description': \"Among the least powerful of Abaddon's daemons, though still exceedingly dangerous, lacridaemons personify death by neglect or exposure to the elements, such as that suffered by those who become lost in the wilderness and die far from help, or are trapped in an enclosed space (like a collapsed mine) and left to slowly expire. Sadly, children are more likely to become lacridaemons than any other type of daemon, and while it's rare for children to be truly evil, those unfortunate children who die from neglect and abuse, or who are abandoned by their parents, are at risk of being twisted and made savage by the experience. Lacridaemons' misery is in stark contrast to their savage nature, and given the opportunity, they viciously lash out, furiously attacking their mortal victims. Burning tears of acid and horrific powers used to strand mortals in perilous conditions make lacridaemons effective combatants against unwary enemies, and their abilities are compounded when the daemons are encountered as a wailing, weeping group. Ecology Pitiful creatures, most lacridaemons suffer in death as their mortal incarnations did in life, consumed by feelings of abandonment, self-pity, and a gnawing sense of loneliness. They often spawn from the souls of evil mortals who died alone and abandoned-exiled criminals, reclusive and corrupt nobles, or those who died from intense exposure to the natural elements, such as by freezing to death or dying of thirst. They are thus often servants of the Horseman of Famine, who makes use of their skills in luring mortals well beyond the edges of civilization, where they ultimately perish due to lack of nourishment. Wracked by an enduring and incurable loneliness even in death, these fiends yearn for the companionship they died without, but only so they can attack and prey upon the souls of those who denied them help in life. They still call out for aid, whispering with a subtle telepathy as well as calling out with weak, pleading voices, begging for help and comfort. In Abaddon, their calls mostly draw out the hunted-namely those evil souls of Abaddon who would seek to take advantage of a stranded innocent-while on the Material Plane they bring forth all manner of doomed altruists. They turn on those who arrive, attacking anyone who would show them the benevolence denied or unattainable to them in life. Of course, the very notion that their daemonic nature might be inf luenced by the dim memories of a mortal soul is disgusting to them, and most reject the idea as blasphemous. Habitat & Society Bef itting their nature, most lacridaemons wander the fringes of daemonic society, abhorring the cities and citadels that populate the greater realms of the Four and their subordinate lords. This self-selected exile has several consequences. First, it ensures that they, as a caste of daemons, receive only the scraps of mortal souls, and rarely does any lacridaemon rise to a position of prominence within Abaddon. Their wandering also brings them into considerable conf lict with the various non-daemonic natives of Abaddon, including nightmares and night hags-but when confronted by powerful foes or outnumbered, lacridaemons usually simply flee. Lacridaemons take great pleasure in pursuing the hunted, leading the already stranded souls further astray throughout the vast wastelands of Abaddon. These hunted never die of starvation or malnourishment, instead subsisting in a constant state of agonizing hunger, and the lacridaemon takes great pleasure in causing such suffering. Solitary and xenophobic, lacridaemons shun the company of other creatures except for other lacridaemons, and even then the fiends largely just cluster together, interacting at a bare minimum. These small lurks of lacridaemons are especially dangerous when encountered in the wild; their maddening whines for help often cause entire parties of travelers to become disoriented and lose their way in treacherous lands. While on the Material Plane, lacridaemons gravitate toward hostile environs such as vast swaths of tundra, brutally hot deserts, and inhospitable swamplands. Occasionally, a lacridaemon will appear near the border of an oasis city or remote outpost, waiting for travelers to leave on the next leg of their journey. The lacridaemon will then follow the unwitting travelers at a distance, waiting until they are far from civilization before coming close enough to let its mind-affecting sobs be known. Lacridaemons use their pitiful whimpering to string prey along for days at a time, until the unfortunate victim has run out of food or water and is on the brink of death. When this occurs, the cunning daemon finally confronts its prey, revealing the true source of the weeping. If it needs to attack, a lacridaemon does so swiftly, savoring the body and reveling in the death of yet another abandoned soul, shedding its perpetual tears all the while.\"},\n",

       "   'description': 'The obcisidaemon personifies the darkest elements of war. Obcisidaemons strip away the veneer of honor and battlefield glory, leaving only the brutal and violent pragmatism at its core, and then divest it of any humanity to reveal naught but scorched earth and genocide. Ref lecting the disgraceful values of ethnic cleansing, depopulation, and all other forms of the clinical, systematic obliteration of civilian populations, obcisidaemons are among the most powerful members of daemonkind. These paragons of inhumanity arrive in the heart of great cities and leave only wastelands of rubble and ashes in their wake. Where an obcisidaemon walks, not even the ghosts of the dead remain to lament the destruction, for the daemon wipes out not only innocent individuals, but also their entire histories and bloodlines, ensuring that no future exists for its victims in any sense of the word. Obcisidaemons stand 25 feet tall, have a wingspan of 30 feet, and weigh over 15,000 pounds. Ecology When a mortal commits a true act of genocide in life and goes to Abaddon in death, it has a chance of forming into an obcisidaemon if it survives long enough as a member of the hunted. Such individuals rarely have trouble managing the unforgiving wastes, as they are willing to destroy any and all possible allies in order to ensure their own survival, making betrayal an impossibility and solitude an inevitability. This vicious soul eventually develops into an obcisidaemon-a lone, wandering mass of slaughter that acts as a harbinger of undiscriminating and unforgiving death to all who dare stand in its path. In life, the soul of an obcisidaemon perhaps only desired to kill a particular chosen population; as an obcisidaemon, however, the being seeks the obliteration of all mortals. Peculiar to an obcisidaemon is the cloak of souls that seems to drip from its enormous body, a symbol of its destructive abilities that provides onlookers an idea as to the sheer scope of its murderous capabilities. When an obcisidaemon lays slaughter to entire populations, it does not feast on all of the souls at once, instead capturing victims for later use. When the fiend needs to unleash a particularly potent rampage upon a resistant population, it consumes its reserve souls in order to strengthen its powers and ensure its success in total annihilation. Habitat & Society Devoted to the wanton, systematic slaughter of mortals, most obcisidaemons serve Szuriel, the Horseman of War, who shares similar ideals. In her service, an obcisidaemon functions as a high-ranking officer at the head of an army of purrodaemons, so skilled are the harbingers of genocide at managing the pragmatic art of organized massacres. Sometimes, an amassed group of obcisidaemons instead trails behind an invading daemonic army, so as to ensure that no trace of the butchered mortals remains but ashes and salted earth. Obcisidaemons not only ensure that all life perishes, but that the land is thereafter uninhabitable by any other creatures as well. Occasionally, an obcisidaemon serves Apollyon, occupying a similar role at the head of a titanic flight of leukodaemons, sowing disease and clouds of poison across miles of terrain in its passing. Some obcisidaemons serve no particular member of the Four, instead choosing to function as independent agents of genocide. These beings wander from plane to plane, laying waste to one civilization after another. Some obcisidaemons intentionally spread their true names to the Material Plane, hoping for a foolish evil summoner to call upon them, knowing that no mere mortal could control their awesome power. Most such summoners end up among the first souls devoured and consumed into the cloud of tormented spirits that cloaks the now-rampaging obcisidaemon.'},\n",

Beneath its shimmering veil, it has glossy black flesh, a bleached white face, and twisted horns. Its long caiman muzzle perpetually gapes, but other than that, its face is void of sensory organs, save for two orbs that move below the surface of its flesh. This creature flows rather than moves, and its flexible body lacks a definite skeletal structure except for a long, bony tail.',\n",
       "   'description': \"Among the most powerful members of daemonkind, the phasmadaemons personify death by fright, and conjure powers of illusion so terrifying that they steal the life from their victims. A freakish creature of rubbery flesh, the phasmadaemon is capable of twisting its body like a hellish contortionist, and its ivory face is often the last thing its victim sees. Though capable of savaging foes with its fangs and claws, it prefers to torment them first with illusory enemies, unreal terrors, and false terrain before finally closing in as the victims' hearts race and finally fail. When a phasmadaemon does confront its prey physically, it prefers to grapple and constrict it to death, looking the victim directly in the face and watching the fear fill its eyes as the blood drains from its cheeks. A phasmadaemon rarely shows its true form all at once, masking itself in illusions or eerie porcelain masks, and it delights in unnerving even its own daemonic allies. A phasmadaemon is 25 feet long from muzzle to tail-though if it desires, it can stretch almost half again that length thanks to its flexible, elastic anatomy-and weighs 1,000 pounds. Ecology Phasmadaemons sometimes form from the type of soul that exemplifies extreme evil, namely those who inf lict or suffer from extreme fear, such as deranged illusionists, schizophrenic serial killers, and corrupt mortals who died at the hands of other creatures that excel at captivating victims' dreams and fears. In other instances, phasmadaemons are merely among the most fearful of the hunted souls of Abaddon, souls who eventually learn to exult in the terror they feel as a soul-devouring daemon stalks them; eventually, these vile souls may transform from the hunted into the hunters-daemons seeking the thrill of the hunt for the horror-stricken faces of their prey. Whether in the chasms of Abaddon or on other planes, phasmadaemons hunt for souls via stealth, following from a distance to study their prey for prolonged periods. They create elaborate illusions, leading their targets into believing in entire fictional environments and creatures, all dependent on the victims' most feared imaginings. They extract each soul's intrinsic, underlying fears, using the figments as weapons against their owners. Phasmadaemons do not seek souls that are merely easy prey-they adhere strictly to their own method of destroying souls, reveling in the grotesque pleasure of striking mortal souls dead with fear-induced heart attacks and other physical maladies. The connection between fear and mortality is something that continually fascinates the morbid curiosities of phasmadaemons, who mix fears like alchemists, conducting experiments and concocting ever more terrifying combinations of horrific imaginings. Habitat & Society Phasmadaemons tend to hunt alone, preferring to develop their own unique styles of torment and horror to unleash upon their victims. While some would suggest that the freakishly complex traps of crucidaemons or the cocooned feeding of sangudaemons rank as the most dreadful and frightening killing tactics among daemonkind, the terrors manifested by phasmadaemons exceed them both. A phasmadaemon extracts a mortal's own fears and turns the figments against their creator, not enjoying the torment the horrors induce so much as appreciating the effects of fear within its victim before the thing's last fatal gasp-the tiny hairs standing upright, the racing heart, jerking muscles, paralysis. Such reactions spawn immense pleasure within a phasmadaemon, which continually seeks ways to fill its victims with dread. Among phasmadaemons, the buying and selling of fears is in itself something of a market, much like the economy of souls within the rest of Abaddon. The fiends exchange their own horrific new imaginings with one another, creating a collection of terrors unfathomable by mortals. Phasmadaemons do not often serve a single Horseman exclusively, their skills not necessarily a boon to any particular facet of death. They tend to traverse the outskirts of societies both within Abaddon and outside of it, preying on travelers in the dead of winter nights or seeking out hermits in order to haunt their isolated homes. The tension before the kill is almost as thrilling to a phasmadaemon as the kill itself, and the foul beings wallow in the fear they create before swooping in for the final blow. When they travel in groups, phasmadaemons use their powers to create great multitudes of illusionary images in order to terrorize entire groups or crowds of closely situated people, such as causing heart-stopping incidents in the middle of a playhouse's performance, situating horrific conjurations in the middle of packed bazaars, and positioning frightful images at the gallows at a crowded execution.\"},\n",

       "   'description': 'A horrid combination of mosquito, spider, and vampire, sangudaemons personify death by blood loss. These horrors of Abaddon takes great pleasure in the act of draining their victims of blood, considering the fluid to be the essence of all mortality and the fundamental residence of the soul while within a mortal body. A sangudaemon bathes in the ruby humor, the fiend\\'s own body resembling a brutal and gory massacre in full swing, with blood constantly coating and glistening its armored, chitinous carapace. Once the last vital drop has left a victim\\'s body-thus depriving the soul of its last defenses, according to the mythology of the sangudaemons-the voracious insectile horror begins to devour its victim\\'s spirit in earnest. An individual sangudaemon stands about 5 feet tall, weighs 200 pounds, and has a wingspan of 6 feet. Ecology A sangudaemon typically spawns from the soul of an evil mortal who died due to blood loss, such as a casualty of giant leeches or mosquitoes, or possibly the drained victim of a ravenous vampire. Whatever the cause, a sangudaemon seeks to inf lict its cruel fate upon others, traversing the planes in search of mortal victims to bleed and consume. Wherever a sangudaemon goes, blood follows, as its mere presence seems to indicate a thinning of bodily fluids and the ensuing chaos of merciless and nondiscriminatory bloodletting. Perhaps more so than any other caste of daemon, sangudaemons \"hunt\" for souls in the most traditional sense of the word. Lurking primarily at night while on the Material Plane, a sangudaemon prowls the darkest corners of urban areas and sparsely populated lands alike, preying on unwary victims and dragging them back to its secluded den. Such lairs are gory, dark places, the walls entirely awash in blood. From the ceiling of a sangudaemon\\'s lair, the fiend hangs the cocooned bodies of countless victims, some still barely conscious beneath their grotesque wrappings-bindings made of hardened blood and the eff luvium of devoured and regurgitated souls. A sangudaemon entombs its victims in these fibrous casings like a giant spider does its prey, slowly sucking the bodies dry of both blood and spirit. Sangudaemons keep their lairs underground or at high elevations in order to best preserve the bodies within, though when the cocoons have been completely leeched, the remnants begin to crumble into dust, and such charnel houses eventually fill with the dry, brittle ashes of victims. Habitat & Society While out hunting in either the wastes of Abaddon or throughout other planes, sangudaemons often work in packs of up to 10 individuals, and though they hunt together, they much prefer to keep their own independent lairs to drag victims back to for slower feedings. Other daemons find sangudaemons\\' potent abilities useful, especially on battlefields where blood is spilt. Piscodaemons and purrodaemons in particular find use for their services, shedding much blood in their destructive rampages and benefiting from sangudaemons\\' unique and devastating control over spilt blood. While sangudaemons sometimes spawn from the souls of blood-drained victims of vampires, the daemons and the undead share no love for one another, and many sangudaemons openly despise vampires. Some speculate that sangudaemons that hate vampires do so because they themselves were victims to the undead as mortals, and a faint and bitter impression permeates their otherwise vacuous recollection. The contempt some sangudaemons have for vampires often runs so deep that the daemons seek out these undead souls in particular, hoping to utterly consume them, as sangudaemons often find vampires\\' tainted blood even more delicious than any other creature\\'s. A sangudaemon will at times trade numerous souls and soul gems via Abaddon\\'s markets for just a single vampire\\'s soul, so much do they delight in the obliteration and consumption of the thing. As such outspoken hunters of vampires, sangudaemons often find themselves at odds with the goals of Urgathoa, Abaddon\\'s resident goddess of undeath. Though most daemons would never dream of siphoning some of her destined souls to sate their own hungers, the mere existence of the two polar forces within the blasted lands nevertheless creates an uncomfortable tension between the fiends and the goddess. What the two sides agree on is excessive gluttony, though Urgathoa\\'s followers often partake merely of food, whereas sangudaemons indulge themselves purely on blood. As a caste, sangudaemons have a distinct preference for service to both Apollyon and Szuriel. Those in service to the Horseman of Pestilence live in his festering swamps and frequently incubate various hemorrhagic fevers and blood-thinning diseases within their various pockets of consumed mortal blood, keeping the diseases alive and active until they can be dispersed through new populations for maximum carnage. Szuriel, meanwhile, spreads the plague of war wherever she passes, and thus bloodshed is an inevitability; whether this large-scale bloodletting is brought on by the tip of a sword or the hungering jaws of a sangudaemon matters not to the Horseman of War, and she gladly accepts the services of the eager and hungry sangudaemons, who are driven to ecstatic revels by battlef ield gore.'},\n",

Its scrawny neck is adorned with three thick iron rings, and a grotesquely long, barbed tongue resembling an octopus's tentacle winds out of its oversized beak.

       "   'description': \"Horrid fiends whose very presence makes the air difficult to breathe, suspiridaemons personify death by suffocation. Discolored and blotched like the stagnant blood of a suffocated corpse, a suspiridaemon enjoys nothing more than the last choked gasp of a victim as it wraps its tongue around the creature's throat. While a suspiridaemon does not normally breathe, its body is nonetheless convulsive and twitchy; coupled with its utterly silent demeanor, they excel at slow, gruesome kills while hiding in the shadows. The only time a suspiridaemon makes a noticeable noise is when it suddenly loosens the binds around its neck and inhales a booming breath, the sudden loss of air enough to make foes fall ill. Ecology A suspiridaemon arises from an evil soul that died by suffocation, drowning, or execution by hanging. Each individual suspiridaemon bears the mark of its particular manner of mortal death-usually in the form of the bruised or mangled flesh of its throat-and the large iron collars around its neck hide such shameful reminders of life, though the suspiridaemon itself is often unaware of this. A suspiridaemon comes into being with the rings already bound around its throat, so that it never witnesses the aff lictions that sent it to Abaddon in the first place. It is thought that should the collars around a suspiridaemon's throat ever be broken, the fiend's head would crook clumsily downward, allowing the monster to see wounds that might remind it of the terrible death it endured in its past existence. Suspiridaemons pride themselves on the number of souls they have deprived of life by strangulation, and this amount often corresponds to the number of iron rings a suspiridaemon wears on its body. While most suspiridaemons are relatively weak compared to their daemonic kin, a particularly skillful individual who is talented at crafting as well as killing can construct iron collars adorned with gem slots, items that give the suspiridaemon the ability to contain the souls of its victims in the rings for trade in the soul markets of Abaddon. When a suspiridaemon is slain, its iron rings disintegrate into ash, and any gems held within are shattered as well, freeing the trapped souls. A suspiridaemon generally uses stealth when confronting foes. Unleashing its long, winding tongue from a dark corner, one of these fiends will strangle an unwary foe in isolation from the rest of the creature's party. When in combat, a suspiridaemon greatly prefers to kill its enemies by its own hands or its barbed tongue, using its arcane abilities and other daemonic gifts to wear down or sow discord into a group of opponents. To a suspiridaemon, there is no act more appreciable than choking the life from a victim, and bringing the creature close to hear its final, distorted gasp. A suspiridaemon prefers to take souls from creatures who are on the verge of death, but aren't quite there yet; the fiend gazes at its victim's expiring face, drawing the dying creature's soul out of it with a solemn suspension of the daemon's normal twitching and convulsing. Those who have witnessed a suspiridaemon draw the life from a creature claim that the fiend almost seems to be inhaling fresh air for the first time as the victim's physical shell expires, and for the briefest moment, the monster appears to breathe normally. The eerie spectacle ends as quickly as it begins, however, as the suspiridaemon sets its gaze upon its next victim, preparing its vicious tongue for another attack. Habitat & Society While many daemons dedicate their loyalty to one of the Horsemen or some other power within Abaddon, either based on their origins, historical ties, or environmental circumstances, no such proclivities exist for suspiridaemons. Suspiridaemons avoid operating under masters whenever possible, preferring more individualistic careers of murder and destruction. They tend to work well with other daemons when forced into doing so, though the more daring individuals tend to stray from Abaddon and gravitate toward population centers on other planes to stalk prey as they please. Suspiridaemons traversing the multiverse in a pack regularly take their small hunting parties into the wilderness around smaller settlements, ravenous in their pursuit of those who stray from the protective gazes of allies. While their killing tactics are as ruthless as any other daemon, suspiridaemons' murders are particularly shrouded in a cold manner of sincere and solemn contemplation, their grisly crimes against souls veiled in a mist of contempt toward the living as well as hatred for themselves. Some speculate that this self-hatred might be connected to the lingering doubts as to their origins, the itch beneath their iron collars that reminds them of their own past mortality. Whatever the cause of their self-doubt, the feeling does not seem to bother most other daemons, who generally view suspiridaemons as useful companions whether inside or outside of Abaddon. Piscodaemons and sangudaemons in particular consider them among the most ideal lesser daemons to command. Suspiridaemons cannot speak, and rarely use their powers of telepathy to communicate, simply nodding discreetly when given a task by a more powerful daemon. This silent subservience only adds to other daemons' general appreciation of their humble and disturbing demeanors, though most are sure to keep the strangling fiends at a distance.\"},\n",

       "   'description': \"Temerdaemons personify the concept of accidental death. A knight falls upon her sword, a peasant trips and breaks his neck, a structure fails in ways its builders never foresaw and buries dozens of innocents, and meanwhile, a distant temerdaemon cackles knowingly. While true accidents please the fiend, it also delights in engineering the mishaps itself, crafting incomprehensibly complex plots that lead to the slaughter of as many mortals as possible. A temerdaemon often wades into the aftermath of such engineered catastrophes, carving apart the crippled survivors and sowing mass confusion and hysteria by its very proximity. A gangly mass consisting of a rotund torso, four arms, and four legs, the average temerdaemon is 10 feet long and weighs 1,200 pounds, not counting its bizarre collection of mechanical fetishes and tinkering equipment. Ecology Lesser fiends who follow in an existing temerdaemon's wake and learn from the daemon's actions are those most typically chosen by one of the Four Horsemen or a member of the daemonic elite for elevation into this terrible caste of crippled giants. Occasionally, however, an evil mortal soul proves worthy of such a station, having died in a singularly horrific accident, especially one engineered by its own hands. In such cases, transition from soul to temerdaemon is swift-on a cosmic scale-and made even swifter by a proclivity to prey upon other mortals. Though Zyphus-the god of accidental deaths and tragedies-is thought by some to be the conceptual father of temerdaemons, the Grim Harvestman has never outright claimed responsibility for them. Nonetheless, he frequently delights in temerdaemons and the infrequent unconsumed souls they send his way. Neither Zyphus nor the temerdaemons seek to disrupt the other's claim over particular souls; they find the destinations of such tragically doomed mortals frequently cross paths, and are as likely to end up in the hands of daemons as the god's minions. Cultists of Zyphus often revel in the doings of temerdaemons, though the daemons themselves despise such worship by the very mortals they seek to destroy. Even slaying these foolish accident-worshipers is hardly enough for the angry temerdaemons, as the daemons' masterfully constructed accidents are wasted on those who actually hope for the horrid events. According to temerdaemons, freak accidents are best engineered for those who go about life with little concern for danger, especially those who least expect such misfortune to befall them. People who watch their backs-including paranoids and betrayers-don't satisfy the morbid desires of temerdaemons as much as the daydreaming child or absent-minded village idiot. No two temerdaemons look exactly the same, as these treacherous beings take on as many forms as there are ways to freakishly die. Particularly powerful individuals may rise to enormous sizes, possessing dozens of legs and arms, as well as multiple heads, all of which strive to wreak as much disaster as possible upon the souls around them. Habitat & Society Temerdaemons wander the multiverse in search of opportunities for sabotage and treachery. Those cultists of Zyphus foolish enough to summon the daemons in hopes of bargaining with them for their services often find themselves victims of their own elaborate rituals. In their most fortunate cases, a temerdaemon arises on the Material Plane only to greet its summoners with its wicked smile and deadly aura, causing chandeliers to fall upon unwary victims' heads, robed priests to trip onto sharp candelabras, and sconces to break off of walls and ignite dusty curtains to set an entire building on fire. Now on the Material Plane, its summoners dead, a temerdaemon strives to create as much havoc and mischief as possible before being banished to its home in Abaddon. If it weren't for the extravagant and terrif ically tragic manner of his worshipers' deaths, Zyphus might be rather displeased with the actions of these cunning daemons, but as it stands, there is rarely conf lict between the two forces, which inadvertently share similar goals. Temerdaemons rarely cooperate among themselves when crafting masterful hazards, preferring to enact their deadly accidents on their own and later boast to their kindred of their massacres. No two accidents are alike, and though temerdaemons sometimes gather in groups of two or three for particularly elaborate schemes, they have no reason to share their techniques or formulate plans for long, as premeditating a particular slaughter is entirely counterproductive in the eyes of a temerdaemon. To these improvisational fiends, an accidental murder is even more satisfying than a mere accidental death. Despite their preference to act alone, temerdaemons at times happily utilize some of their lesser kindred as unwitting cogs in their disastrous plans. Particular among these pawns are the miniscule cacodaemons, which frequently cluster in numbers of up to a dozen around a given temerdaemon, ready to absorb and regurgitate the souls of their greater kindred's kills. When a temerdaemon cannot attract cacodaemon followers, it simply captures them, and any given temerdaemon of considerable power can often be found with dozens of these least daemons impaled on barbed hooks, stuffed into tightly drawn satchels, or crammed into small cages, each container dangling from its myriad straps, belts, and holsters.\"},\n",

       "   'description': \"The venedaemon personifies death by magic, and so possesses an inborn talent for all manner of sorcery. As hungry for souls as any other member of its daemonic brethren, the venedaemon thirsts equally for intangible wealth through the acquisition of knowledge, so that it can best utilize the arcane magic lurking within its blood. In particular, venedaemons yearn for the secrets and magical lore held within the bindings of wizards' tomes, knowing that these arcane formulae are the key to unlocking their mysterious powers. In the process of acquiring such tomes of knowledge, venedaemons invariably come across other forms of information-whether it be info regarding a rival daemon's weaknesses, lore that hints at a wealth of unclaimed souls hidden in one of Abaddon's vast caverns, or a rumor of some hidden and terrible source of daemonic power-that they can make use of in trading with other daemons. These rumors and smatterings of advice can be sold to other daemons for captured souls, and the trade often goes both ways, as venedaemons are also inclined to trade their hard-earned soul gems for tomes of magic other fiends may have chanced upon. In addition to its myriad magical abilities as a daemon, a venedaemon casts spells like a sorcerer with a caster level equal to its Hit Dice. A venedaemon can gain additional levels as a sorcerer in order to bolster its arcane powers, in which case it gains a bloodline (usually Abyssal or Infernal) as well as a sorcerer's other class features and special abilities. Venedaemons are gaunt, and despite standing close to 7 feet tall, they rarely weigh more than 150 pounds. Ecology Like all mundane daemons, venedaemons most often form from the hunted, specifically from those evil souls who died as a result of the abuse of magic-whether by their own greedy hands, at the whim of powerful rivals, through the inadvisable pursuit of knowledge too terrible for them to safely handle, or by other spellcasters who slew them for their crimes. While these hunted were often spellcasters themselves, some venedaemons develop from nonmagical souls that were simply casualties to arcane violence. These individuals are often so tainted with the magical disturbances that killed them that they nonetheless develop arcane powers in an ironic twist of daemonic evolution. Other times still, venedaemons formulate from much odder means. Occasionally, mortal wizards seek to control the awe-inspiring forces of Abaddon and its daemons by using cacodaemon as familiars. The cacodaemon, for its part, is usually willing to serve a mortal master for a time in this regard, though it usually has ulterior motives for its servitude. When a cacodaemon familiar's master dies, the daemon is often prompt in devouring the mage's soul and turning the soul into a soul gem. Instead of the soul gem returning to Abaddon and being consumed by a more powerful daemon, sometimes the deceased mage's power triggers a reaction within the cacodaemon, fusing with it and transforming the familiar over several weeks or months into a new creature, typically a venedaemon with no memories of its mortal or previous daemonic existence. Far from being a hazard, this possibility of transformation is in fact one of the primary reasons why cacodaemons are sometimes eager to serve as familiars, as it represents one of the only ways for a cacodaemon to advance its station. Habitat & Society Most venedaemons are relatively weak compared to the towering daemonic brethren that inhabit Abaddon, and knowing this, they often work together as best they can, collaborating in groups with other venedaemons, or in conjunction with other fiends willing to accept their services. Hurled into Abaddon with an innate talent for magic but only scraps of its mortal knowledge remaining, the average venedaemon ultimately flocks to the service of a more powerful daemon willing to act as a patron that lets the venedaemon pursue its studies. In such arrangements, the venedaemon slowly gains power and inf luence within the confines of its daemonic partnership, which often consists of itself, its daemonic master, and many other daemons acting as a team built on the shared goal of total mortal annihilation. This daemonic horde traverses planes searching for opportunities to create mass destruction, the master simply using the venedaemon for its magical qualities to slaughter mortal souls. As the venedaemon gleans what it can from the charred remains of dead mortal spellcasters' volumes of scribbled formulae, it gradually strengthens its unspeakable powers, and in time, the tables are turned, and when the venedaemon slays its patron, it gains dominion over dark magic as well as its brethren. Those venedaemons who do not wish to submit to the will of a more powerful daemon in order to pursue knowledge often simply prefer to be left alone to their research, experimenting on mortals with their dark arts and occasionally selling their findings to other daemons for souls and magical artifacts. Venedaemons find themselves aligned with the lesser fiends of Abaddon, particularly the equally lowly ceustodaemons, whose deathly association with the energies and particularly subservient standing among daemons makes the two obvious allies. Cacodaemons also make for suitable alliances, as a venedaemon may help guide its smaller brethren to capture the soul of an opposing spellcaster, allowing the cacodaemon to mature with the soul and in time develop into a fellow venedaemon. Within the realm of Abaddon, venedaemons gravitate toward the River Styx for its mysterious, memory-wiping properties, for many venedaemons themselves find a peculiar yearning for their memories, if only to regain even more of the power they once possessed, somewhere in the dark recesses of their mind.\"},\n",

They are known and feared by sailors on many exotic shores, as well as by common folk who just happen to live near the ocean. Many have witnessed a fellow sailor or fisher suddenly go rigid, a poisoned spear jutting from his guts, only to fall into the water and be taken by the vicious adaro responsible for the assault. Strictly carnivorous, adaros feed upon their victims almost immediately after slaying them. Their brutally sharp teeth cut through bone almost as easily as through flesh, and their powerful digestive systems are capable of handling most organic matter. Adaros usually eat once every couple of days, gorging on meals half their weight. Adaros' strange relationship with storms has intrigued scholars for centuries. These sea-dwellers have a special connection to the deadly creatures of the water and the wildness of foul weather, and it is no coincidence that they attack humanoids more often during rough seas. Adaros are seminomadic by nature; a tribe travels until it finds a suitable hunting ground, and leaves either when its presence becomes too well known or when its game runs low. An adaro is 7-1/2 feet long and weighs 250 pounds.\"},\n",

Many become oracles or druids, but all adlets know their place in the natural world. One in every dozen adlets is a shaman: an adlet with the advanced creature template and the ability to summon a greater ice elemental or 1d4+1 large ice elementals (see Bestiary 2 114) and commune with nature once per day each as spell-like abilities.

       "   'description': \"A carnage-hungry denizen of swamps, the ahuizotl is a ferocious-looking predator, even before one takes into consideration its most distinctive feature-a long tail that ends in a clawed but alltoo-humanoid hand. Whether from the entrance of its aquatic home (typically a sunken mass of trees or a flooded cavern) or the thick reeds and flora that grow at the water's edge, an ahuizotl remains watchful for any intruder that might trespass into its territory. Upon sighting such prey, the beast uses its uncanny ability to mimic the sound of a humanoid in distress to lure victims near, so it can snatch them with its tail claw. Ahuizotls are particularly fond of feasting upon a victim's eyes, and their tail claws are particularly adept at swiping away such organs for the beasts to feed upon. Teeth and fingernails are another of the creature's favorite meals, and the appearance of mutilated bodies missing eyes, teeth, and nails along a river's banks is sure evidence of an ahuizotl attack. Despite its preference for cruelty, an ahuizotl might come to mutually advantageous arrangements with other pernicious denizens of the swamps. Will-o'-wisps and ahuizotls often find themselves in such cooperative relationships, with the will-o'-wisp coaxing creatures near the ahuizotl's lair and then lingering to feed upon the victims' fear as the ahuizotl drags them into the depths. Some wily humanoids who fall into an ahuizotl's clutches-typically lizardfolk, boggards, or swampdwelling humans-have successfully managed to bargain away the lives of others in exchange for their own. Such arrangements always lead to a series of vicarious murders, as the aquatic predator's proxy coaxes new victims into the swamp for its fearsome partner to dine upon. Ahuizotls are exceptionally long-lived, and a single individual might live and feed in a particular area for several human generations. An ahuizotl is 9 feet long and weighs 1,200 pounds.\"},\n",

Legend holds that the first akhlut was born fully-formed in the eye of a polar hurricane, the merciless anger of the elements made flesh. Whether or not the tale is true, the akhlut's ferocity is certainly as memorable as that of any storm. While the akhlut appears as a wolf-orca hybrid on land, when it enters the water, its legs and fur vanish and it transforms fully into the form of an orca. Akhluts are particularly skilled at charging into and out of water, their transformation between shapes occurring in the blink of an eye. Each akhlut fiercely defends its hunting grounds from other predators, and especially against other akhluts. While this does reduce the number of dangerous predators in a region, it's unclear whether replacing lesser predators with something as dangerous as an akhlut is actually preferable. Typically, an akhlut considers its territory to be the boundaries of the storm created by its control weather spell-like ability, and rarely travels far from this storm's borders. An akhlut is 22 feet long and weighs 8,000 pounds.\"},\n",

       "   'description': \"Those who fall prey to madness and take their own lives sometimes find themselves lost on the path to the afterlife, trapped in a state between life and death. These unfortunates, known as allips, suffer from the violent and incurable insanity they faced in life and take out their terror, confusion, and rage upon the living. They reach out to those they encounter-possibly in wrath, but also perhaps oblivious to their own insane nature-spreading the psychoses that led to their own untimely deaths. In combat, allips relentlessly attack the nearest living creature, relying on their babble to let them close in before attacking with their touch of insanity. Many seem to be driven to states of ferocity upon witnessing the terror living creatures exhibit when facing their spectral forms, or when faced with the intangibility of their incorporeal states. While allips have no way to kill creatures, those knocked unconscious by an allip's Wisdom-draining touch often emerge from the state suffering from insanity (see pages 250-251 of the GameMastery Guide)-a fate that many would say qualifies as worse than death. Allips often seek to harm those who played a part in causing their mad, unholy condition. When faced with such foes, an allip ignores all other targets that confront it in favor of its hated enemies, attacking them until its tormentors have been forced into a vacant stupor. Alas, such vengeance does not put the allip to rest, but simply serves to further fuel its madness as it finds itself trapped in a world now no longer even holding the satisfaction of vengeance.\"},\n",

At rest, an alraune appears to be merely a large thorny plant with a single enormous and brightly colored flower at its center. When an alraune attacks, its thorny vines lash out and its flower blooms, revealing an attractive, green-skinned humanoid form within. An alraune's apparent gender can vary even from encounter to encounter, for the plant can reshape its humanoid portions as it desires to increase the likelihood of setting its victims at ease. Regardless of the plant's apparent gender, it is itself asexual and reproduces (typically once or twice per decade) by budding a single offspring over the course of a spring season. Despite their appearance, alraunes are quite mobile (capable of walking almost like a spider upon their numerous long roots and thorny vines). They hunt by using commune with nature to locate potential prey, preferring humanoid flesh over all others. When an alraune needs prey, it uses its mind-affecting abilities to convince foes to dig their own graves and bury themselves-once a foe is helplessly buried in the soil, the alraune can feed from it via its flesh-burrowing roots, converting the victim's blood and memories into the strange nutrients it so craves.\"},\n",

       "   'description': 'When the gods of nature or powerful spirits desire a champion to defend the animal world, they invest a token of their power in a chosen vessel-be it animal or humanoid. Traditionally, only one animal lord for a specific animal species is active on a world at any one time, although sometimes, when an extant animal lord strays from its charge or otherwise fails, the force that created it might create a replacement to send against the fallen animal lord to challenge it in a combat to the death, with the victor claiming the right to rule or a chance at redemption. An animal lord does not dwell among humanity-the wild is its domain. How an animal lord interacts with a humanoid society largely depends on how that society treats the animals of that lord\\'s affinity. Societies that honor and respect those animals, even if they use the animals as a food source, earn the animal lord\\'s (sometimes grudging) respect, but those who abuse or otherwise harm animals of that lord\\'s species find a powerful and ardent enemy in the lord. The cat lord above uses a leopard as the base animal-this particular cat lord represents a newly created animal lord. The longer an animal lord exists, the higher its level should be. CREATING AN ANIMAL LORD \"Animal Lord\" is an inherited template that can be added to any humanoid of 10 Hit Dice or more, referred to hereafter as the base creature. The animal lord also gains the characteristics of one type of animal (of a size no larger than one step larger than the base creature\\'s size), referred to hereafter as the base animal. CR: Same as the base creature or the base animal (whichever is higher) +2. Alignment: Any neutral. Type: The base creature\\'s type changes to outsider (native, shapechanger). Do not recalculate class Hit Dice, BAB, or saves. Senses: An animal lord gains the senses of both the base creature and the base animal in both of its forms. AC: An animal lord gains the base animal or base creature\\'s natural armor bonus, whichever is higher, in both of its forms-this bonus is increased by +2 to determine the animal lord\\'s actual natural armor bonus. Defensive Abilities: An animal lord gains DR 10/silver. It also gains all of the base animal\\'s defensive abilities in both of its forms. Speed: An animal lord\\'s base speed is that of its base creature form or its base animal form, whichever is greater. Animal lords whose base animal has a burrow, climb, fly, or swim speed can use that mode of movement even in humanoid form, instantly growing the necessary appendages as necessary. Melee: An animal lord in humanoid form can instantaneously transform parts of its body to make all of the natural attacks possessed by the base animal. An animal lord typically prefers to use its natural attacks in melee combat, but often carries manufactured ranged weapons to diversify its combat options as well. Special Attacks: An animal lord gains all of the special attacks possessed by the base animal and can employ them in both humanoid and animal form. It also gains abilities determined by its species affinity (see below). Ability Scores: Animal lords use the higher ability score between the base creature and the base animal as their base ability scores, then increase all of these ability scores by +4. Skills: An animal lord gains all of the base animal\\'s racial modifiers to skill checks. Special Qualities: An animal lord gains the following special qualities. Change Shape (Su): An animal lord has two forms-a humanoid and an animal form. When an animal lord in humanoid form uses the base animal\\'s defensive abilities, movement types, attacks, and other features, the animal lord\\'s body instantaneously changes as appropriate to allow the use of that ability, growing wings or claws or fangs as necessary. The animal lord can use this ability to take the shape of the base animal (as shapechange) as a move action. Dominion (Su): In both forms, an animal lord is treated as if constantly under the effects of a speak with animals spell, but this only applies to creatures of the animal lord\\'s species affinity (see below). In addition, an animal lord can cast charm animal on any animal of its affinity as a spell-like ability at will (CL equals the animal lord\\'s HD). Species Affinity Animal lords can be made from almost any creature of the animal type, but most are grouped into larger categories known as species affinities. The most common animal lord kingdom affinities are detailed below, but many others exist. Animals listed in parenthesis list typical base animals for that lord. Bear Lord (Grizzly Bear): Bear lords have broad shoulders, sharp teeth, and thick fingers. Bear lords gain the following additional ability. Bear Hug (Ex): A bear lord deals +1d6 extra points of damage when it makes a grapple check to damage a creature. Canine Lord (Dog, Hyena, Wolf ): Canine lords are hirsute, have pronounced canines, and have slightly pointed ears. Canine lords gain the following additional ability. Savage (Ex): A canine lord deals +1d6 extra points of damage on its first attack in a round against a prone opponent. Cat Lord (Leopard, Lion, Tiger): Cat lords move with a fluid agility, and have slender bodies and catlike eyes. Cat lords gain the following additional ability. Leap (Ex): A cat lord adds half its Hit Dice to all Acrobatics checks made to jump, and is always treated as if it had a running start when jumping. Crocodile Lord (Crocodile): Crocodile lords have reptilian eyes, sharp teeth, and a scaly ridge along the spine. Crocodile lords gain the following additional ability. Thick Skin (Ex): A crocodile lord\\'s base natural armor bonus improves by an additional +2 in both of its forms. Dinosaur Lord (Deinonychus, Tyrannosaurus): A dinosaur lord tends to have sharp teeth, scaly skin, and a booming voice. Dinosaur lords gain the following additional ability. Primeval Mind (Ex): A dinosaur lord is immune to charm effects and gains a +2 bonus on all Will saves. Raptor Lord (Eagle, Falcon): Raptor lords have feathery-looking and brightly colored hair, wide searching eyes, and aquiline noses. Raptor lords gain the following additional ability. Raptor\\'s Dive (Ex): A raptor lord deals double damage with any charge that starts 10 or more feet above its target. Rat Lord (Giant Rat): Rat lords have pointed chins and pointed ears, and move with quick, jittery motions. Rat lords gain the following additional ability. Hearty (Ex): Rat lords are immune to disease and gain a +2 bonus on all Fortitude saves. Shark Lord (Shark): Shark lords have black eyes, pale skin, sharp teeth, and little to no body hair. They gain the following additional ability. Brutal Jaws (Ex): A shark lord\\'s bite attack causes bleed (1d6). Serpent Lord (Snake): Serpent lords tend to have unusual skin colors, often with stripes or other patterns), snakelike eyes, and forked tongues. Serpent lords gain the following ability. Poison Immunity (Ex): Serpent lords are immune to poison'},\n",

       "   'description': \"Also known as black hags or iron hags, annis hags are the largest and most physically intimidating of their foul brood. Known for their iron-hard, wart-covered skin that varies from shades of deep blue to black and their claws like rusty blades, annis hags forgo much of the cunning and deceptiveness of their kind to revel in the more visceral evils of torture and slaughter. The typical annis hag stands just over 8 feet tall and weighs upward of 300 pounds. Dwelling in dark caves, tangled hollows, and cursed ruins deep within frozen swamps or icy moors, annis hags stalk forth by night to sow fear and hunt the unwary. Although possessed of cunning minds, annis prove more decadent than most other hags, frequently indulging in their taste for living flesh and the music of pleading screams. Unlike green hags, they use their ability to assume humanoid form via alter self not to infiltrate societies but to lure victims into a false sense of security before attacking-often posing as travelers in need of aid or pilgrims seeking to share a camp. Annis hags find the flesh of children, young animals, and the pure of heart particularly pleasing, both for the tenderness of such meals and for the sorrow such murders spread. After gorging themselves, these hags delight in stripping the skin from their victims, often garbing themselves in the grisly trophies. They are also known to retain and even preserve identifiable portions of their victims (such as heads) for later use in spreading misery. An annis who eats the children of a local farmer might keep the heads (or at least the faces) handy to return to the victims' parents, for example-often in the guise of an anonymous gift. The most insidious of annis hags present these gifts in ways that implicate friends or family in the victim's death. Like most hags, annis sometimes join covens of their repulsive sisters, though many prove resistant to such cooperation. They are particularly unlikely to join covens that already include other annis, though groups of related annis-typically horrible triplets-are not unknown. A typical annis coven consists of one annis leader along with two green hags or sometimes even a witch or two. Annis covens often seek to recruit additional creatures as guardians and are particularly fond of trolls and ogres for such roles.\"},\n",

These tiny beings serve as heralds and assistants for the forces of Heaven. While on the Material Plane, they advise mortals on how best to serve the causes of order and light. Some even venture to the other Outer Planes as minor ambassadors. Harbingers can also be bound into service as familiars, a role they accept eagerly, taking full responsibility for guiding their masters' souls toward salvation. A spellcaster must have the Improved Familiar feat, a lawful good alignment, and be an arcane caster level of 7th or higher to gain a harbinger familiar. A harbinger resembles a whirling mechanical model of a planetary system. Its sun, moons, and planets are crafted of tiny glowing jewels whose color shifts with the harbinger's mood. Electric arcs and sparks of magical essence dance between its whirling pieces. The harbinger can dismantle itself into its component parts to squeeze through tiny gaps, its rings dissolving into glowing vapor while its star and planets remain. Harbingers shed light as brightly as a torch under normal conditions, but can dim to a faint glow if desired, and frequently spin off bits of their essence into dancing lights. A harbinger archon's voice resembles the ringing of a dozen tiny bells, and regardless of the language the archon speaks, it retains that tinkling musical quality. Most harbinger archons form from souls that led simple lives of wisdom and piety before their deaths. They remember nothing of their mortal existences, but retain a decidedly practical, if parochial, view of worldly matters. Only rarely does a harbinger want for a parable or proverb apropos to the task at hand.\"},\n",

       "   'description': \"Oversized fungi, ascomoids are frequently mistaken for giant puff balls until they begin to move, rolling toward any living prey that they sense. Once they have crushed the life out of a creature, they quickly move on, leaving spores behind in their victim's body to grow new ascomoids. Ascomoids can grow to a width of 10 feet, but they rarely weigh more than 400 pounds. While ascomoids require no light to grow, they do require a moist environment. They do not keep traditional lairs, but often wander the same areas over and over, littering these routes with the bones of past victims. Although they are typically solitary creatures, ascomoids dwelling in areas of ample moisture with generous sources of food-or frequent unwitting passersby-sometimes form deadly clusters. Such colonies of these giant fungi often lurk in large caverns among other pallid vegetation. Given ascomoids' ability to detect vibrations, the slightest quake or potential footfall sets them rolling, turning their cavernous lairs into churning meat grinders. Bounding about violently, groups of ascomoids sometimes take hours to settle back down, unable to distinguish between the movements of prey and the tumbling of their own kind. In some cases, ascomoids have been known to lair at the top of steep rises, crushing climbers as they roll in terrible fungal avalanches. Those crushed by an ascomoid or who fall victim to an ascomoid's spores face a revolting end, their bodies becoming hosts to quick-growing colonies of rampant fungi. Immature ascomoid mold sprouts quickly, typically appearing within 24 hours. After 48 hours, such victims become so overgrown with this furry, brown-green mold that they can no longer be restored to life by raise dead, as their bodies are too vitally pervaded and thoroughly consumed by the swiftly spreading mold. Within a month, a new ascomoid emerges from the foul mess.\"},\n",

An adhukait is adept at infiltration and escape. In killing, the fiend is brutally efficient unless it wishes to prolong pain to demoralize or enrage its enemies. Although an adhukait appears to be two connected creatures, it is one entity with two minds. The creature's personality and purpose is as unified as its bizarre form. An adhukait is 6 feet tall. It weighs 330 pounds. Adhukaits prefer desolate spots as lairs, especially those that recall past terror or sorrow. In such dens, they keep trophies from their engagements as focuses for meditation and objects of study. Adhukaits also keep treasures stolen from temples and holy places. While at rest, adhukaits remain near any ill-gotten items to ensure no meddling magician can locate the lost objects. Legend holds that the first adhukaits emerged from the shattered remains of two godlike brigands. These burglars, their names long since lost to history, attempted to raid a celestial hall. The resident deity and his or her servants slew the thieves, crushed their bodies together into one, and hurled their remains to the earth. As their crumbling, entwined bodies struck the world, they caused terrible earthquakes and tsunamis that slew thousands of innocents-including many worshipers of the headstrong deity who accidentally caused the devastation.

       "   'description': 'With the notable exception of the unique asura ranas, asurendras are the mightiest of their kind. Although few asurendras possess anything resembling an extended realm, in Hell or elsewhere, these asuras are the \"wise ones\" of asura kind. Most dwell within shrinelike fortresses in which they can practice their ruinous mysticism and command lesser asuras who seek their teachings. To most asuras, an asurendra\\'s order is something akin to a deific edict. Each asurendra is a humanoid creature of immense proportions. Their exact appearance varies just as the appearances of humanoids vary, but all asurendras have six arms and multiple eyes and heads. An asurendra\\'s body is an example of physical perfection, athletically and gracefully built, but its face has monstrous or inhuman features, such as tusks or bizarrely placed features. Most asurendras are 19 feet tall and weigh 8,000 pounds. Few asurendras were born to their might-they achieve their power only over the course of countless lifetimes spent as lesser asuras. Throughout each incarnation, these tenacious asuras sought unity with some concept of destruction. Eventually, through dark meditation and vile action, the asuras ascended to a state of being united with some aspect of unmaking. They also gained power over their own being and slowly reshaped themselves into a vision of their perfect selves, instruments of annihilation ideally suited to fell gods and their divine works. In battle, an asurendra does its best to destroy all enemies, taking a moment to ensure death when any foe falls. Asurendras enjoy eating the bodies of fallen foes, and some can even use the flesh and bone of those they consume to create new asuras to serve them. BLASPHEMOUS SAGES Each asurendra follows its own bliss toward a specific method of vengeance against the divine. Like philosophers dispensing wisdom, they teach their ways to others so that more asuras might ascend into perfection. Listed here are some ideas of the vile ways asurendras might use their \"enlightened\" hatred. Death: All living things can die. Instead of war, an asurendra can focus on the aftermath of war. Such an asurendra replaces quickened baleful polymorph with quickened slay living and quickened blade barrier with quickened circle of death. Its spirit blades deal negative energy damage, not force damage, and can thus be used to heal allied undead creatures as easily as they can serve as weapons against the living. Sacrilege: Blasphemy is joy to any asura, but truly impious asurendras learn talents that mimic divine miracles. Cults to these asurendras, which almost always seem benevolent on first glance, turn people from the worship of real deities. These asurendras do not possess a spirit blade special attack, but can use miracle as a spell-like ability once per day as long as the miracle granted is in keeping with their blasphemous design. Shaping: Some asurendras like to remake what the gods have created. Nothing escapes a shaper\\'s vision, and its enemies find their bodies, minds, and souls are like clay in a shaper\\'s hands. An asurendra sage of shaping lacks a spirit blade special attack, but gains the following special ability. Create Asura (Su): As a full-round action, an asurendra can turn a creature that it has eaten within the last 24 hours into a tripurasura (see page 26) that it then excretes into existence. Such tripurasuras remain loyal to the asurendra that created them as long as they remain tripurasuras. If an asurendra has enough tripurasuras at hand, it can consume them as well and transform them into more powerful asuras using this ability. An asurendra can transform any tripurasuras it has eaten within the last 24 hours into a number of Hit Dice worth of other asuras equal to the number of tripurasuras it has consumed. An asurendra can create as many tripurasuras as it wishes with this ability, but can only create more powerful asuras by combining multiple tripurasuras once per day. An asurendra cannot create another asurendra with this ability. A newly formed asura considers the asurendra to be its master. Not all of a creature\\'s soul is consumed when it is used to create a tripurasura-beings swallowed and used to create asuras in this manner are dead, but can be restored to life as normal.'},\n",

       "   'description': 'Tripurasuras, or sly ones, are among the weakest asuras, manifestations not of divine mistakes but instead creations of the most powerful of asuras exhibiting their loathing of the gods by creating blasphemous mockeries of their creations. A newly created tripurasura most commonly exists for one of two reasons: to give an asurendra sage the raw materials it needs to create more powerful asuras, or to seek out mortals-especially mortal spellcasters-to recruit into the asura cause. Using its power to assume a pleasing or innocuous form, a tripurasura wanders the world, seeking pious mortals to corrupt. When it encounters a promising spellcaster (typically one who has some sort of link to a church or religion, but not necessarily a divine spellcaster), the tripurasura presents itself as an apprentice, pilgrim, or other type of curious student eager to learn from the spellcaster. The tripurasura keeps its true nature and its powers hidden, and seeks opportunities to steer its \"master\" away from decisions it might have made in good conscience to acts that promote the collapse of religious belief, faith, and society. When, as it inevitably does, the wayward spellcaster runs afoul of justice or is confronted by those seeking revenge, the tripurasura fades away to watch the final stage of the spellcaster\\'s fall from grace, then seeks a new victim in another city or region. Some spellcasters, on the other hand, actually seek out these tiny fiends to employ as familiars. A tripurasura greatly values these opportunities, since it need not abandon its master once its work is done and can continue to spread its agenda for as long as its master survives. A spellcaster must be lawful evil, at least 7th level, and have the Improved Familiar feat to gain a tripurasura as a familiar.'},\n",

Upasundas seek monklike poise and skill, and through it, the ability to deal flawless destruction wherever they go. Their nickname suggests purity, and indeed, each beatific one is an expression of asura purity through devotion to the ideal of annihilation. It is believed that the first upasundas were created from the jealous followers of a man who achieved divinity through his own force of will. Those of his followers who felt abandoned when this new deity ascended to the Great Beyond sought other ways to achieve immortality, and fell pray to one of the asura ranas, who granted them their desire by transforming them into beatific ones. Upasundas never surrender to foes in combat and rarely flee from battle. They hope to increase in skill and wisdom or to die in battle. On either path lies evolution toward a greater understanding of destruction in its countless forms. An upasunda is 7 feet tall and weighs 240 pounds.'},\n",

Like pups standing up to a full-grown cur, atomies never back down from aggression, and take tremendous pride in defeating and humiliating foes larger than themselves. Atomies find great pleasure in shoring up the odds in a fight against larger foes. They make use of their reduce person spell-like ability as an offensive measure, hoping to shock and humiliate humanoid opponents, giving them a chance to make a killing jab. Atomies employ their invisibility spell-like ability to get in close and make sneak attacks before darting back out of reach. In lands thick with fey, atomies often serve as border sentries or bodyguards to nymphs, dryads, or other more powerful fey creatures. While atomies prove only passable in their ability to defend such creatures, other fey accept their fealty out of respect and perhaps with a bit of mirth as well. Atomies enjoy their time as honor guards, but often grow bored and leave their posts in search of adventure. These nimble creatures adore swordplay and practice with their blades endlessly. Atomies often travel their lands seeking adventure tinged with mischief. Sensitive to bullying and oppression, atomies revel in turning the tables on a cruel mayor or tormenting dishonorable mercenary bands. Atomies, enamored with tales of epic duels and the defeat of great evils, sometimes follow adventuring parties and eavesdrop on their nightly tales by the campfire. If a warrior in the group tends to boast of his swordplay, an atomie rarely resists the urge to humble him by sabotaging his equipment or invisibly reducing him and challenging him to a duel. Atomies get along well with grigs, and it is not uncommon to see the two types of creatures banding together for defense or companionship. Some sages claim the two creatures share a past link, pointing out their similar insectile wings. Anyone questioning an atomie or grig about this theory is greeted with bouts of shrill tiny laughter.

       "   'description': 'Keen-witted and powerful avian predators, axe beaks compete with wolves and hunting cats for prey upon vast, open steppes and prairies. Although feared for their boldness and territorial natures, these giant birds prove eminently tamable, making useful guardians, hunters, and even steeds when kept well fed. Axe beaks are relatively social creatures, forming small groups in which both males and females hunt together. They nest in immense mounds made of sticks, branches, leaves, and whatever else they can scavenge (including the bones and equipment of previous meals), with each nest used by a large group of axe beaks. Females typically lay clutches of 1d4+1 eggs once per year, which the parents take turns keeping warm for 2 months before they hatch. Mature axe beaks stand 9 feet tall and weigh as much as 500 pounds. Their plumage varies widely, from gray to brown to black in temperate climes, but taking on exotic shades of gold, red, blue, and other vibrant hues in more tropical environs. Axe beaks have lifespans of up to 50 years. An axe beak requires training before it will bear a rider. Taming an axe beak requires 6 weeks of work and a DC 25 Handle Animal check, after which it can be taught tricks as normal. Riding an axe beak requires an exotic saddle. Axe beak eggs are worth 1,000 gp apiece on the open market, while young are worth 1,500 gp each. A light load for an axe beak is up to 200 pounds; a medium load, 201-400 pounds; and a heavy load, 401-600 pounds. Other types of large, predatory flightless birds exist-the axe beak is but the most commonly encountered and well known of this breed of predator. Two less common variants of the axe beak are summarized below. Diatryma: While the dark-feathered, orange-beaked diatrymas are smaller than the average axe-beak, standing at a mere 6 to 7 feet in height, they are no less ferocious. Diatrymas are axe beaks reduced to Medium size; they have 2 Hit Dice and are CR 1. Terror Bird: Terror birds stand a full foot taller than the average axe beak, and their powerful talons serve as additional weapons. Terror birds are axe beaks advanced to 5 HD that gain Improved Critical (bite) as a bonus feat. They also have two additional natural attacks, a pair of talons that do a base damage of 1d4 damage each. Terror birds are CR 4. Axe Beak Companions Starting Statistics: Size Medium; Speed 50 ft.; Attack bite (1d6 +1-1/2 Str); Ability Scores Str 10, Dex 17, Con 12, Int 2, Wis 11, Cha 10; Special Qualities low-light vision. 4th Level Advancement: Size Large; AC +2 natural armor; Attack bite (1d8 +1-1/2 Str); Ability Scores Str +8, Dex -2, Con +4; Special Attacks sudden charge.'},\n",

       "   'description': 'Bandersnatches are consummate hunters, and only the deadliest predators or the most cunning intelligent prey offer them sport. Once a bandersnatch has marked a creature for death, it runs it to ground without fear, rest, or remorse. Bandersnatches rely on speed, shock, and terror to bring down prey. They pace their quarry from a distance, hidden among the trees, then break from cover, savage their target, and dart away again. They drag smaller creatures away to dispatch at leisure, while engaging larger ones in skirmishes until they gradually wear their prey down. An outmatched bandersnatch withdraws at full speed, from their allies. Once its wounds heal, the bandersnatch returns to the scene of its defeat, picks up the trail of its assailants, and eliminates them one by one. In appearance, a bandersnatch resembles a tawny, six-legged great cat, but with wickedly barbed quills running the length of its body and down to the tip of its long, flexible tail. Its quills serve to deter attackers, but also act as a formidable weapon. With a single flick of its muscular tail, a bandersnatch can fling as many as a half-dozen quills at distant foes with surprising accuracy. A bandersnatch captivates any prey that meets the gaze of its saucerlike, luminous eyes. A bandersnatch measures 40 feet in length plus another 10 feet of tail and weighs 12,000 pounds. Despite their bulk, bandersnatches move with speed, grace, and even considerable stealth when required. Bandersnatches were once native to the primal world of the fey, where they preyed on the greatest hunters of that ancient realm. As with other legendary creatures from this realm, such as the jabberwock, bandersnatches belong to a group of creatures known collectively as the \"Tane.\" Whether the fey were careless in guarding their portals or released the first bandersnatches into Material Plane deliberately cannot be said with certainty. Rare in the extreme on the Material Plane, bandersnatches lair within forgotten forests where ancient beasts walk the world. Bandersnatches mate only rarely. A female becomes fertile perhaps once or twice per century, leaving the male soon after mating and giving birth to only one or two kittens per litter. The mother brings meat to her ravenous young, which mature into lesser bandersnatches (see below) within a year. Bandersnatches live for a thousand years or longer. VARIANT BANDERSNATCHES Though no bandersnatch is ordinary, some are rarer than others. The most famous is the frumious bandersnatch, brimming with rage so fierce it burns. Variant bandersnatches may combine two or more of the abilities below. Confounding Bandersnatch (+1 CR): Confounding bandersnatches drip infectious madness from their quills and claws. Poison (Ex) Claws and quills-injury; save Fort DC 29; frequency 1/minute for 6 minutes; effect confused for 1 minute; cure 2 consecutive saves. The save DC is Constitution-based. Frumious Bandersnatch (+2 CR): A frumious bandersnatch seethes with barely repressed rage and anger. If it misses with its bite attack or falls below half of its hit points, it succumbs to such uncontrollable fury that it bursts into flame. While engulfed in these flames, a frumious bandersnatch is affected as by a haste spell (this effect cannot be dispelled) and causes an additional 2d6 points of fire damage with each of its melee attacks and its quill defense ability. The fury lasts for 5 rounds, after which the bandersnatch cannot enter a fury again for another 5 rounds. A frumious bandersnatch has fire resistance 30. Lesser Bandersnatch (-4 CR): Smaller or younger bandersnatches are still fearsome predators in their own right. A lesser bandersnatch is Huge, with 4 fewer Hit Dice than a typical bandersnatch. Reduce its physical ability scores by 4 each and its Wisdom and Charisma by 2 each. A lesser bandersnatch lacks quick recovery and deals 1d8+4 points of damage with its quill defense and pain abilities. Lesser bandersnatches never have any additional variant powers. Magicbane Bandersnatch (+3 CR): These bandersnatches radiate an antimagic aura in a 20-foot radius. Should the aura be brought down, it returns automatically as a free action on the bandersnatch\\'s next turn. Magicbane bandersnatches lack gaze and quick recovery. Primal Bandersnatch (+2 CR): Primal bandersnatches have kept their ties to the ancient world of the fey. They have the extraplanar subtype, SR equal to 11 plus their CR, DR 10/ cold iron, and the advanced creature simple template.'},\n",

Of course, to the baregara\\'s victims, these debates are incidental. In the Abyss, baregaras form small troops just like the apes of the Material Plane. These troops are led by the strongest fighter or an individual anointed by a powerful demon the baregara troop serves. Rivalries between troops are part of a complex hierarchy that is all but incomprehensible to non-baregaras, but planar scholars have observed that all baregaras take trophies from notable kills, and that these grisly mementos play some role in establishing the convoluted social standing of the troop leaders and their followers. Even when knuckle-walking on their enormous hands, baregaras stand over 12 feet high when measured to the top of their horns, and their dense bodies can weigh up to 1,500 pounds.'},\n",

When such remorseless hunters perish before they can capture and kill their quarry, they sometimes rise from death as baykoks-flying undead horrors that kill purely for the ecstasy that only murder can bring them. Unlike many undead who feed on and hate all living things, a baykok seeks always to prove its mastery of the hunt. Though thoroughly wicked, baykoks often ignore all but the most powerful-looking foe in a group, only picking off lesser creatures if they dare to get between the baykok and its true prey. When it finally lays low its quarry, the baykok swoops down on the victim to devour the creature's soul in an attempt to make sure the creature never returns to seek revenge.\"},\n",

Despite their massive bulk, thalassic behemoths swim incredibly fast and can easily outpace all but the fleetest of ships. On land, they can be more readily escaped, at least by those willing and able to leave homes and belongings behind. Though capable of surviving indefinitely on land and employing a clumsy, seal-like locomotion, thalassic behemoths soon weary of gravity's never-ending drag. They rarely venture more than a mile or two from shore before returning to the comforting buoyancy of the seas. Thalassic behemoths resemble immense sperm whales in the water, but they can quickly haul themselves ashore using their mighty forelimbs. Tail and limb alike shatter wood and stone with but a single blow, while their jaws gape wide enough to swallow smaller boats whole. The coming of a thalassic behemoth is foreshadowed by a dramatic increase in missing ships and sea life purposefully beaching upon shores. These behemoths spend much of their time lurking a few hundred feet below the surface-but legends hold that even greater behemoths, the dread leviathans, dwell in the deepest oceanic reaches.\"},\n",

       "   'description': \"A bhuta is a ghostlike undead creature born of horrible death or murder in a natural setting. It is a manifestation of rage at the injustice of a death that interrupted important business or unsated desires. Doomed to haunt the wilderness within several miles of the site of its demise, a bhuta turns to the local fauna as tools for its vengeance. A bhuta can appear in a variety of animalistic forms by using its veil ability, but its natural appearance is that of a bestial humanoid phantom that floats a foot above the ground as it moves. While bhutas are incorporeal, the touch of their claws creates horrific, bleeding wounds. A bhuta's feet point backward. To disguise its nature, a bhuta can appear solid, manifesting in long robes that help disguise the fact that it floats and has strange feet. By means of its magic jar spell-like ability, a bhuta can also possess living animals to use as its minions; an animal possessed by a bhuta casts no shadow, and therefore prefers to lurk in heavily canopied or thicketed areas, waiting for the right time to strike out and attack intruders. Animals find themselves attracted to bhutas, which use their spell-like abilities to manipulate such victims toward evil and deceptive ends. Bhutas generally avoid inf luencing animal companions or domesticated animals, for changes in behavior among such creatures can easily arouse suspicion and reveal a bhuta's presence and inf luence. A bhuta might have tasks it wishes to complete from its previous existence as a living creature, or it might work against those who slew its living form. This link to its past life is vague and compulsive rather than clear, unlike that of a ghost. Bhutas who have no specific target for retribution still seek to trouble those living in or near their domains, coaxing passersby into accepting them as traveling companions and using their inf luence over animals as a testament to their benevolence. When invited to join a group, a bhuta can journey outside its normal territory. However, a bhuta's hunger for living blood usually drives it to attack its companions before it wanders far.\"},\n",

Others see bogeymen as supernatural manifestations of society's willingness to do itself harm. Bogeymen use their powers to haunt houses or secluded natural places where they can hunt prey unobserved. They relish using their ghost sound ability to hint at their presence long before they fully reveal themselves. It is not uncommon for a bogeyman to hide under a bed, or in a closet left slightly ajar, for days or even weeks, all the while feeding on its victims' growing realization that they are not alone. The most evil bogeymen are those who abandon the tactic of feeding on one person's fears at a time and take up roles of mass murderers or serial killers, or other pursuits designed to drive fear into the hearts of an entire city of victims. True to their name, all bogeymen are male. Sometimes, children whom they steal away to secret lairs emerge years later, transformed into new bogeymen, and return home to continue their supernatural father's work.\"},\n",

The creature\\'s thought patterns are unusually powerful, and cause painful mental feedback in the minds of other conscious beings. Other intelligent beings are nothing more than cattle and playthings to brain oozes-victims to be tormented, thought patterns to be consumed. Brain oozes prefer to manipulate their prey from the shadows. Rather than assaulting openly, they provoke fights and conf lict within groups, or lure one or two victims away for the kill. Brain oozes derive particular satisfaction from forcing an individual to commit terrible acts, then wiping away all knowledge of the crimes from the victim\\'s memory. They torment such hapless puppets again and again, forcing them to commit ever greater atrocities. Once weary of their sport they return the modified memories with dispel magic, and feast upon the delicious misery of the victim\\'s final despair. Brain oozes feed through their tentacles by extracting the thoughts of living creatures. Animals and less intelligent creatures provide little nourishment, but they prize fey, outsiders, and spellcasters as delicacies. After several feedings, a brain ooze divides into two nearly identical brains, each retaining only a portion of the knowledge and experiences of the parent. The similarities between intellect devourers and brain oozes have not gone unnoticed, but the two species appear to have little in common beyond appearance. Some theorize that brain oozes are actually the result of an ancient race\\'s failed attempt to achieve immortality by preserving their minds via alien technology or magic.'},\n",

Carbuncles exhibit a peculiar attraction to magic-users, especially sorcerers with the fey bloodline and any who pack supplies of fresh fruit. Many enchanters laud the extraordinary mind-control powers of these intense creatures and extol the aid they can offer mages of their field-though others consider such tales something of an academic in-joke.

       "   'description': \"Caryatid columns are the lesser cousins of true golems, constructs created by spellcasters to guard objects or areas. Unlike true golems, caryatid columns cannot be made into shield guardians, but they are often used in greater numbers because of their relatively inexpensive creation cost. Each caryatid column is programmed to guard an object or area when created, and once set, this command cannot be changed. Caryatid columns are often given specific parameters concerning whom to ignore and whom to attack, but since they have no special form of detection, such restrictions can be overcome with disguises if the parameters are known. A caryatid column stands 7 feet tall and weighs 1,500 pounds. Caryatid columns are always equipped with a masterwork weapon that appears to be made out of stone as long as the construct remains in statue form. The weapon can be recovered after a caryatid column has been defeated. Arming a caryatid column with magical weapons is expensive but feasible-even the most powerful of magic weapons appear as nothing more than stone when held by a caryatid column. Since a weapon held in this manner does not radiate magic, many use this trait as a method to hide potent or powerful weapons from both casual observation and study via detect magic. True seeing reveals such disguised weapons for what they really are. Often, only particularly powerful caryatid columns (typically those with advanced Hit Dice, but rarely those made much larger than Medium size) are entrusted with the care and protection of such weapons. Of course, the constructs themselves make full use of any magic weapons they are given to guard. Construction A caryatid column's body is carved from a single 2,000-pound block of stone, such as granite or marble. The stone must be of exceptional quality, and costs 2,000 gp. CARYATID COLUMN CL 9th; Price 12,000 gp Construction Requirements Craft Construct, lesser geas, polymorph, shatter, caster must be at least 9th level; Skill Craft ( sculpting) or Craft (stonemasonry) DC 15; Cost 7,000 gp\"},\n",

As a culture, catfolk are loyal, generous, and amiable. They like belonging to and being at harmony with a group whose members work together to accomplish their needs and wants. Tribal catfolk prefer for the most capable societal members to lead, so every tribe has a council of elevated subchiefs. A tribe's chief is usually the most competent (and magically talented) member of that tribe. Personal growth is part of catfolk culture, as is expression as a means of personal exploration. Catfolk have few taboos, and often exhibit harmless but strange eccentricities. Individuals cultivate a wide range of pursuits and self-expression, taking risks others might label unwise. Most individual catfolk like to be the center of attention, but not at the cost of group cohesion. CATFOLK CHARACTERS Catfolk have no racial Hit Dice, gaining their capabilities from class levels. All catfolk have the following racial traits. +2 Dexterity, -2 Wisdom, +2 Charisma: Catfolk are agile and amiable, but they are known for their lack of common sense and self-control. Low-Light Vision: In dim light, catfolk can see twice as far as humans. Cat's Luck: See above. Sprinter: See above. Natural Hunter: Catfolk receive a +2 racial bonus on Perception, Stealth, and Survival checks. Languages: Catfolk speak Catfolk and Common. A catfolk who has a high Intelligence score can choose from the following bonus languages: Elven, Gnoll, Gnome, Goblin, Half ling, Orc, and Sylvan.\"},\n",

Cecaelia stand 6 feet tall on land, and weigh just over 200 pounds. They generally live to be 60 years old. Cecaelias don\\'t normally wear clothes, but often carry woven seaweed backpacks. They prefer not to wear armor, though when they do, they prefer light, flexible varieties. Tattoos are a common form of decoration as well. Cecaelias are inquisitive creatures, but wary of strangers, and are quickly frustrated by wordy attempts at diplomacy-which they nearly always view as attempts at deception. As allies, they can be valuable to coastal communities since they often dig up treasures from the seabed that they then trade for fragments of polished glass or bits of \"land fare,\" as they refer to food not taken from the sea.'},\n",

Cerberi draw upon a legendary pedigree, all reputedly tracing their lineage to a single primordial evil beast said to still guard the foundations of some forsaken, deathly realm. Brethren to hell hounds, cerberi loathe their distant kin, viciously attacking such hellspawn if not kept at heel by a tyrannical master. In their natural infernal environments, cerberi might be found anywhere powerful fiends have need for guardians. Cerberi's incredible ability to trap victims on planes and track the dead make them highly coveted servants across the multiverse. The hounds' bestial appearances and love of slaughter often cause those who consider themselves cerberi owners to forget the deviousness of their allies, a development that often ends poorly, if not bloodily, for the unwary and the weak. Outside of the devil-tamed reaches of Hell and other foul extraplanar wildernesses, small groups of cerberi gather in harsh, packlike communities. Typically dominated by the strongest or wiliest member, such packs form swift and deadly throngs, stalking trespassers upon their vast hunting grounds and doggedly pursuing any scent of lost souls. Although cerberi gain no sustenance from attacking the dead, all gain a vicious satisfaction at the feeling of an immortal essence discorporating forever within their deadly jaws, as befits their infernal nature.

Gigantic but dull-witted, these massive savages are usually loners, but occasionally either need or fate drives them to rampages from which few are safe. Such undeniable force brings with it a dread that, in many instances, grows to reverence, giving rise to strange cults that cloak these cyclopes with veils of menace and dark legends. Denizens of remote and primeval parts of the world, great cyclopes typically dwell in lands where none might intrude upon them-deserted islands, high craggy mountains, and stoic hill countries often provide the great caves they favor as lairs. While most avoid well-traveled or populated lands, spending much of their time hunting megafauna and even monstrous prey in the wilds, some, driven by hunger or a desperation to wander, seek out the paths and settlements of humanoids, finding that their fragile buildings are easily shattered and that the mewling creatures make savory meals.

Most often formed from the souls of evil creatures killed by family or friends, vulnudaemons spread their insanity throughout the worlds by deceiving and killing all creatures they meet. Vulnudaemons stalk their prey, infecting them with a sense of impending doom and watching their reactions, learning their responses before attacking and savoring their death. These daemons serve as excellent assassins, hiding in the shadows before debilitating their enemies, or striking from the protection of invisibility in order to deliver the killing blow. When facing stronger enemies, vulnudaemons seek to wear them down through a series of attacks, nicking at them and darting off, then repeating the process until their opponents bleed out. Vulnudaemons often find themselves called to the Material Plane by cultists of deities associated with murder and assassination. These cultists often see vulnudaemons as sacred creatures favored by their deity, and rather than simply use the daemons as assassins, cultists often grant them a shocking degree of freedom to wander the region as they will, picking victims to fit their own agendas and murdering whomever they wish. Cultists who conjure vulnudaemons into the world usually take care to show the daemons a secret hand sign or other code that members of the cult can show them, lest the monsters decide to target one of the believers for an attack. Whether or not an accidentally targeted cultist has the time to flash her safety sign to the daemon should the creature attack her at a later date is, of course, another matter. Vulnudaemons stand 3 feet tall and weigh 25 pounds.'},\n",

Thought to be related to ochre jellies, the deathtrap ooze is up to 12 feet wide and 6 inches deep in its normal, mobile form. While moving, it shrinks a foot or two in width, gaining about 6 inches of height, and rolls forward in a quivering mass. Deathtrap oozes are less inclined to look for prey than are other oozes-they prefer to hunt by ambush. Their ability to assume the form of simple mechanical traps has long intrigued scholars, but this ability is not something born out of intellect as much as by supernatural cunning. A deathtrap ooze lacks any creative ability-it can only mimic traps that it has encountered during its wanderings, and even then, the repertoire of trap designs it can draw upon is limited to just the last few it has encountered. These oozes surely have an origin rooted in magical meddling. Countless ancient crypts have such oozes within, lurking patiently in ageless trap form, awaiting would-be tomb-raiders for a first-in-centuries breakfast. Those who have studied the deathtrap ooze suppose that wizards of some lost culture altered ochre jellies into perfect guardians. Like ochre jellies, elder deathtrap oozes can grow to be enormous. Rumor holds that some can also duplicate even more complex traps that release toxic fumes, spray acid, or contain poison. Some even claim there are oozes so huge that they can duplicate traps that fill entire rooms with multiple moving parts.'},\n",

The spells that create this monstrosity bind to it thousands of normal spiders, which together form the mind of the undead beast like an arachnid hive. These smaller spiders live in and direct their exoskeleton home, working together to swarm around the deathweb and weave its web sheets. The exoskeleton of a deathweb is cracked and full of holes to allow the resident spiders easy passage into and out of it. Although the exoskeleton can be up to 10 feet long, the largest spiders within are only 6 inches in length. The variety in the sizes of the internal spiders allows them to ably move all parts of the exoskeleton, giving the massive carapace amazing dexterity and swiftness, as well as cleverness, perception, and presence. These capabilities make deathwebs resourceful and frightening opponents, especially when adversaries mistake them for normal monstrous arachnids or mindless undead. Because of their ability to squeeze into tight surroundings, deathwebs may be found lurking in all manner of niches. Deathwebs lair where they can build webs to trap passersby, such as among thick trees or in caves or tunnels. The creatures don't actively collect valuables, but they kill indiscriminately to feed the multitude of spiders within. Webs in a deathweb's lair are thus likely to contain valuables despite the creature's lack of interest in wealth.\"},\n",

       "   'description': \"In their endless years of unlife, some liches lose themselves in introspection, and can no longer rouse themselves to face the endless march of days. Still others cast their consciousness far from their bodies, wandering planes and realities far beyond mortal ken. Absent the vitality of the soul, such a lich's physical form succumbs to decay over the centuries. In time, only the lich's skull remains intact. Yet the bonds of undeath keep the lich's remains from final dissolution. Vestiges of the lich's intellect remain within the skull, and wake to terrible wrath should it be disturbed. Traces of the lich's will to live strengthen the skull, rendering it harder than any steel. The lich's greed and lust for power manifest in the growth of gems in its skull. Lastly, though only the barest remnants of the lich's eldritch might survive, a demilich aroused to anger still retains enough power to flense the very soul from any defiling its final rest. The lich's phylactery invariably fails during the slow decline of lich into demilich, losing its last vestiges of enchantment if not crumbling into dust with the lich's body. But even without the preserving power of the phylactery, demiliches retain a tenacious grip on existence. Only powerful and precise use of magic can permanently destroy a demilich and its remains. To the unwary adventurer, a demilich looks like nothing more than dust and bones within the lich's former sanctum. Indeed, until disturbed, a demilich has only the vaguest awareness of intruders, and ignores their presence. Any attempt to steal the demilich's possessions, disturb its remains, or harm its domain rouses the demilich's slumbering mind, causing it to rise up in the air and voice its wail of the banshee before again settling to the ground. Should the interlopers relent, the skull returns to its torpor. But if they persist, the skull rises again, not to rest again until all in its sight have perished. Fortunately for intruders, demiliches never pursue those wise enough flee. BECOMING A DEMILICH Most demiliches achieved their state through apathy, not volition. For each decade that a demilich fails to stir itself to meaningful action, there is a 1% cumulative chance that its corporeal body decays into dust, save for the skull. Any return to activity resets the chance of transformation to 0%. Once the lich's body decays, the lich's intellect returns to its phylactery as normal. However, the skull rejects the return of the lich's consciousness, keeping the lich trapped in its deteriorating phylactery for 1d10 years. If during that time the lich's remains are destroyed or scattered (for example, by wandering adventurers), the lich's phylactery forms a new body and the intellect leaves the phylactery as normal, returning the lich to life. But if the lich's remains survive unperturbed, the phylactery's magic fails catastrophically, releasing the lich's soul and causing 5d10 points of damage to the phylactery. Regardless of whether or not the phylactery physically survives, the energies released by its failure channel into the lifeless skull of the lich, allowing the last remnants of the lich's soul to transform it into a demilich. The lich's soul itself either is utterly destroyed, reaches its final reward or punishment, or is condemned to wander the edges of the multiverse forever. For wandering liches, the process is similar, but based on the number of decades the lich spends without its intellect returning to its body. While the lich's body still decays, its mind remains at large, only becoming trapped in the phylactery if the lich tries to return during the period in which its body has failed, but it has not yet become a demilich. Should the lich's phylactery fail before the wandering lich returns, the skull becomes a demilich, and the lich's mind is doomed to wander until the end of days. AWAKENED DEMILICHES Under exceptional conditions, a lich's full consciousness survives its transformation into a demilich, or a lich's wandering intellect manages to return to its jeweled skull. Such creatures are awakened demiliches, and combine the powers and near-invulnerability of a demilich with the mind and spellcasting prowess of a lich. An awakened demilich has the full spellcasting abilities of the lich it was before, and gains Eschew Materials and Still Spell as bonus feats. Awakened liches keep their original lich Hit Dice, and any mental attributes that are higher than the demilich's minimums. They otherwise have all the special abilities and defenses of a demilich, except torpor, and no abilities of the original lich beyond spellcasting and mental attributes. An awakened demilich has a CR of 16, or the CR of the original lich +3, whichever is higher.\"},\n",

A coloxus is 6 feet tall and weighs 150 pounds. Ironically-given their grotesque, insectile appearance-coloxus demons are demons of vanity. They are formed from the souls of narcissistic mortals responsible for disasters or tragedy through their careless self-absorption. Despite their foul appearance, coloxus demons consider themselves cultured and elite. They are unusually patient and well mannered for demons, and as a result are often used as emissaries, diplomats, and negotiators by marilith generals, balors, and even demon lords. Even when facing hated foes, coloxus demons are the epitome of courtesy, but such manners are always a deceitful veneer, masking the creatures' efforts to gain the upper hand. Evil mortal spellcasters are fond of conjuring coloxus demons for similar roles, but the monsters also work well as assassins. Even in this role, a coloxus is dignified and polite. Only when presented with a ref lection of itself does the normally civilized coloxus show its true demonic colors-any creature foolish enough to trick a coloxus into looking at a mirror finds herself the eternal foe of an insulted and scandalized demon.\"},\n",

Incubi stand between 6 and 6-1/2 feet tall and typically weigh 200 pounds. When not in battle, incubi serve as counselors, torturers, and companions for greater demons. They are also often conjured for similar roles by mortal spellcasters, although care must be taken in dalliances with incubi, for they delight in causing pain to their companions. Like succubi, incubi form from the chaotic evil souls of particularly lustful and rapacious mortals.

A ragged hide covers patches of a schir's body, usually around the forearms and lower legs, with a crestlike patch running down from the creature's crown to the nape of its neck. Schir demons are 7 feet tall, though they usually stoop and so appear shorter, and weigh 300 pounds. Also known as spite demons, schirs are among the most violent and vile-tempered inhabitants of the Abyss. Schirs are formed from the souls of mortals who either committed or framed others for heinous crimes-acts committed for the sole purpose of petty retribution. Despite such origins, schirs occupy one of the lowest orders in the demonic hierarchy, often serving as front-line infantry in demonic armies or as guards for minor demonic commanders. Although not especially intelligent, schirs are cunning warriors and able sentries. Although they prefer to charge into combat, a schir's natural jumping ability makes it a nimble enemy, capable of using its surroundings astutely. A schir will often jump on top of rocks, crumbling walls, or any other high place to hack with its disease-ridden halberd. For all of schirs' capabilities, their spitefulness makes them distrustful of any creature that has not proven its greater power and strength numerous times. A schir set loose upon the Material Plane quickly seeks to set itself up as a leader of its own army-often, schirs seek out tribes of savage humanoids and attempt to replace the current leaders. They are particularly fond of infiltrating gnoll tribes.\"},\n",

Derhii form relatively small groupings known as troops, which usually consist of a single adult male, several adult females, and their offspring. Occasionally, multiple males or females band together in single-gender troops with no young, but such groupings are usually formed for a specific purpose, such as hunting, raiding, or war, and break up when they have fulfilled that purpose. Multiple troops of derhii form large primitive tribes, usually under the rule of a single powerful chieftain. Derhii often roost in jungle canopies and in cliff dwellings, preferring nests woven in tall trees or cliff-side caves high above ground level. From these roosts, derhii sometimes demand tribute from lesser apes, while allying themselves with even more powerful flying creatures, such as dragons or dragonnes. Occasionally, derhii can be found inhabiting crumbling and overgrown ruins hidden deep in the jungle. Derhii are carnivorous by nature and hunters by preference, attacking prey from high above with javelins thrown from their powerful arms before descending to finish things off with their blades, but when meat is scarce, they eat fruits and roots or whatever else they can forage.'},\n",

       "   'description': \"A contract devil, also a called phistophilus, always appears handsome and confident, its chiseled features housing a perpetually smug grin. Contract devils have red skin and black hair and stand near 6-1/2 feet in height, not counting their horns. The thicket of horns around a contract devil's body increases its height to 7 feet and its weight to 350 pounds. Contract devils serve Asmodeus, archfiends, and the vast bureaucracy of Hell as clerks, scribes, and bargainers for mortal souls. They exist to keep track of the damned, to manage Hell's endless ordinances, and, when time and opportunity permit, to coax mortals into damnation. Most phistophiluses spend their eternities in the various courts of Hell's nine layers, particularly in the maze-like fortress-libraries where all infernal laws and oaths are recorded. Occasionally they serve similar roles on the Material Plane when summoned by particularly desperate, arrogant, or foolish mortals. When one of the souls damned by a contract devil is restored to life (typically via powerful magic like a wish or miracle), the phistophilus immediately notices the transgression. Usually, the contract devil recruits the aid of more powerful allies to track down and punish such transgressors and to collect the escaped soul as quickly as possible. INFERNAL CONTRACTS While numerous types of infernal contracts exist, the following two are those most often offered to mortals by contract devils. Evil Wishes: Upon signing this contract, a mortal is granted three wishes, as per the spell. It must use these wishes within 24 hours of signing the contract-if it does not, the wishes are wasted but it remains bound to the contract nevertheless. While the mortal chooses the intention of the wishes, the contract devil decides upon the specifics, allowing for its own diabolical interpretation of the results should the mortal imprecisely phrase a wish. Infernal Slave: A mortal can negotiate with a contract devil for the lifelong service of a devil. The mortal chooses any type of devil (except for a contract devil) of a CR equal to or less than its own character level at the time of the bargain. Upon signing the contract, the mortal's infernal slave appears and is bound to do the mortal no harm and follow its orders for as long as it lives. Although the devil must obey its master's commands, many devils delight in corrupting the intentions of these orders in all manner of cruel or mischievous ways. BREAKING AN INFERNAL CONTRACT An agreement with a contract devil can only be broken in two ways. When a contract is signed, a second copy manifests; one copy is retained by the devil and the other is given to the mortal. Mortals are free to do whatever they please with the lengthy, obviously evil documents, while contract devils typically keep active contracts with them at all times. Should both copies of a contract be destroyed, any effects caused by the contract are canceled or reversed and the mortal's soul goes to its normal place of rest after death and can be resurrected as normal. Merely absconding with both copies of the contract is not enough to break the contract-as long as both copies exist, the signer's soul remains forever damned. Alternatively, a second mortal might be allowed to adopt the terms of a contract-with its soul replacing that of the original contract signer after death. The mortal who seeks to pay the debt of another must contact the contract devil who holds the relevant contract. The contract devil has a choice of whether or not to allow one mortal to pay another's debt, but values religious and good-aligned souls over others. Shrewd manipulators, contract devils often only agree to allow one mortal to pay another's debt in return for some service or proof of worth. If a contract devil agrees to accept another soul in payment, the original contract signer retains all of the benefits of the contract, but is released from damnation and may be resurrected as normal. The new signer, however, receives no benefits, cannot be returned to life upon dying, and spends an eternity in Hell after death.\"},\n",

Their twisted minds bend toward desolation, ruin, and blasphemy, and their hatred of the gods of creation and beings renowned for inspiring art and wonder knows few equals. Whereas most divs turn their cruelty and vengefulness exclusively upon mortals, akvans broaden the scope of their hatred to encompass geniekind as well. Akvans seek out wonders to destroy-monuments from lost ages that have long inspired awe and pride or beings and establishments said to be invincible. While divs typically spread their taint through more subtle ways, akvans target symbols for destruction, bringing down not just stone and mortar but hopes and dreams. Additionally, these masters of destruction promote the creation of new horrors, transforming their most hated victims, genies, into nightmares known as ghuls. Thus, an akvan's evil does not end with its victim's death, as slain genies arise from the battlefield-or are belched up from an akvan's gullet-as blasphemous undead servants. These undead minions serve their terrifying master and, over the ages, gather around it as an army of profane slaves. Hatred and hunger for genies and those allied with them constitute the racial compulsion to which all akvans bow. These divs always go out of their way to hunt, destroy, and consume any genie they encounter. While wise enough to not waste their lives in combat against foes obviously more powerful then they, akvans seek to bring low any such opponents, if not by brute strength, then by guile. Akvans stand approximately 40 feet tall and weigh over 30,000 pounds. AKVAN PRINCES As akvans go through existence slaying mortals and genies, many gravitate toward one of the races of geniekind, targeting members of that race with particular passion. Over ages of service, akvans who prove especially lethal in slaughtering genies garner the attention of Ahriman, who blesses such divs with increased power, transforming them into akvan princes. Each akvan prince dedicates itself to extinguishing a particular type of genie and gains special abilities with which to slaughter genies of that type. An akvan prince gains an additional 4-8 Hit Dice, a +4 bonus to three ability scores, and has a CR of 22-24. The akvan prince also gains one of the following sets of abilities, depending on what type of genies it hunts. Crumbling Earth: A shaitan-hunting akvan prince shatters the strongest stone. It gains the stone glide ability, tremorsense 100 feet, and a burrow speed of 100 feet, and its natural attacks are treated as adamantine for the purposes of overcoming damage reduction. It also gains the following spell-like abilities: 3/day-quickened stone shape, transmute mud to rock, transmute rock to mud, wish. Dying Ember: An efreet-hating akvan prince holds dominion over flame. It gains an efreeti's heat special attack (1d6 when struck, 6d6 when grappling or grappled) and the following spell-like abilities: at will-quickened quench, scorching ray, wall of fire; 3/day-wish. Gasping Wind: A djinn-hunting akvan prince gains power over the wind. It gains resist electricity 30 and the whirlwind ability, its fly speed increases to 120 feet (perfect maneuverability), and it gains the following spell-like abilities: at will-invisibility; 3/day-gaseous form, wish. Thirsty Sea: A marid-slaying akvan prince controls and poisons water. It gains a swim speed of 100 feet, a marid's water's fury special attack (8d6 points of damage, blinds and stuns for 1d6 rounds), and the following spell-like abilities: constant-water breathing, water walk; at will-quickened control water; 3/day-horrid wilting, wish. Unbalanced Soul: A jann-killing akvan prince spreads failure and defeat. It gains resist acid, cold, and electricity 20, and the following spell-like abilities: at will-ethereal jaunt, invisibility; 3/day-insanity, mage's disjunction, wish.\"},\n",

       "   'description': \"Dorus are the divs that whisper in the night, the foul inspiration that drifts upon fetid winds, the messengers of pretender gods. Wild hair whips around a doru's six twisting horns, while a flat nose, a fanged mouth, and red glowing eyes complete the terrifying image of this bodiless monstrosity. Dorus almost always fly, preferring to stay at heights that keep them at the eye level of those with whom they would have dealings. When not flying, dorus roll across the ground in a disturbing manner, horns bouncing and teeth clattering as the creatures cackle and cartwheel, terrifying children and shocking the faint of heart. The least of the divs, dorus serve as messengers and servants of other divs and sometimes mortal spellcasters. While not strong combatants, dorus prefer to sow ruin in more subtle ways. They enjoy tainting mortals with exaggerated news and outright lies, trying to turn impressionable beings to waste and wickedness. Even if a doru fails to fully corrupt an intelligent being itself, it attempts to weaken the target's will, making the victim more pliable to future corruption and ruin. All divs have some manner of esoteric flaw in their personalities-dorus are obsessed with secrets. These covetous fiends hoard secrets and legends like a miser hoards gold. This thirst for information causes the curious dorus to enter into ridiculous bargains to obtain hidden knowledge from those they believe hold tales of special interest or value, especially when such information has the potential to aid in the corruption of future souls. Such bargains are usually what seal dorus to servitude, whether their service be to other divs or to mortal spellcasters. Cunning creatures, dorus often act as double (and sometimes triple) agents, but they rarely maintain this complex series of lies and deceptions for long. Dorus abhor mortals, as all divs do, and find it difficult to remain obedient to such beings for more than a span of a few decades at most. Only the most precious and profane secrets have the potential to keep a doru faithful to a mortal master for more than a century. Serving greater divs or mortal spellcasters, divs deliver messages, most directly plucked from secret sources. Dorus' spell-like abilities make them excellent spies, granting them the ability to infiltrate, eavesdrop while invisible, and charm their way out of perilous situations. Those serving mortals pride themselves on manipulating their masters into furthering the divs' own ends. Many evil spellcasters seeking profane power and ancient evil secrets seek to take dorus as familiars. A neutral evil spellcaster of at least 7th level who takes the Improved Familiar feat can select a doru as a familiar.\"},\n",

In its true form, a pairaka's body is a foul landscape of blazing rashes, oozing pustules, and taut blisters suggestive of the corruptions it harbors, bodily and spiritually. Pairakas pride themselves on perversion. They love nothing more than turning lovers against one another or destroying the bonds of friendship. Pairakas feed off this slow torment and savor each broken heart or disappointment. They use lust and sexuality as their primary tools, wielding taboos and carnal appetites to sever once-friendly relationships. Pairakas also use their seduction to spread disease, charming victims into physical contact. Just as all other divs suffer a weakness, pairakas cannot stand the color red. They never wear the color or enter a place that is painted red, and they always attack creatures that are garbed in clothes of a crimson hue first.

       "   'description': \"Bestial stalkers, shiras live to hunt and feed. Resembling anthropomorphic lionesses, these divs use their powerful builds, keen senses, and deadly instincts to track the proudest mortals and slay the most formidable foes. They embody the deadly nature of the wilds and the dispassion with which beast and land might turn against mortals, delighting in proving to civilized beings how small and helpless they are in the face of a savage world. Shiras prefer hunting alone, keeping company with even others of their own kind only long enough to form temporary hunting bands. With a hunger for intelligent prey, they savor the taste of mortal souls, savaging not just victims' bodies but also their vital essences. Despite being the most feral of all divs, shiras sometimes serve as scouts and assassins for div hordes. Such arrangements usually prove to be temporary, however, lasting only until the shiras' savage instincts or lust for the hunt again takes hold. Shiras never go after an easy kill, and instead target the most obviously powerful of the possible targets. When acting on this compulsion, a shira weighs its chances for survival and the glory of its intended kill, planning its tactics carefully and not necessarily charging savagely forth. Though savage, a shira is also a cunning hunter and might wait weeks for the perfect opportunity to bring down its chosen prey. Most shiras stand 10 feet tall and weigh approximately 1,200 pounds.\"},\n",

       "   'description': \"Related to pseudodragons, faerie dragons are whimsical, playful pranksters that spend most of their time either relaxing in cool forest glades or engaged in some sort of prank. Although such mischief is usually spontaneous, some faerie dragons have been known to spend months or even years in preparation of one truly spectacular joke. Travelers making their way through lands known to be inhabited by these good-natured-but sometimes annoying-tricksters are advised to keep up their guard lest they face all manner of creative annoyances (horses painted with berry juice, squirrels placed inside bedrolls, and clothing decorating high branches being a few examples). Unlike true dragons, faerie dragons do not grow larger with age, but their scales do change color, starting with red and moving through the rainbow to reach dark violet at old age. Faerie dragons grow in power as spellcasters as they age (typically gaining levels in sorcerer), learning more powerful spells to complement their innate abilities. The spells of faerie dragons tend to focus on tools that can be used to create or enhance pranks, and illusion and enchantment spells are particularly popular. Faerie dragons avoid combat unless there is no other option. If forced to fight, faerie dragons attempt to confound enemies rather than kill them, using both spells and breath weapon to weaken and scatter foes before fleeing. The only exception to this is when a faerie dragon's clan or allies are in danger. As capricious as these tiny dragons can be, many prove quick to bond with goodly creatures, especially fey and others they find interesting or hilarious-adventurers often fall into this latter camp, particularly those most outraged by a faerie dragon's tricks. Faerie dragons sometimes ally with spellcasters, serving as curious, occasionally reckless, but always true familiars. An arcane spellcaster of at least 7th level with an alignment within 1 step of chaotic good who has the Improved Familiar feat may select a faerie dragon as a familiar.\"},\n",
